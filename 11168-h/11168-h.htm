<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</center>
It is solely the historical aspect and worth of the two tracts
herewith presented that appealed to their edition and first
suggested to him their preparation and publication.&#160; Had
preparation in question depended for its motive merely on
considerations of the texts' philologic interest or value it would,
to speak frankly, never have been undertaken.&#160; The editor, who
disclaims qualification as a philologist, regards these Lives as
very valuable historical material, publication of which may serve
to light up some dark corners of our Celtic ecclesiastical past.&#160;
He is egotist enough to hope that the present "blazing of the
track," inadequate and feeble though it be, may induce other and
better equipped explorers to follow.
<p>&#160; &#160; The present editor was studying the Life of Declan for
quite another purpose when, some years since, the zealous Hon.
Secretary of the Irish Texts Society suggested to him publication
of the tract in its present form, and addition of the Life of
Carthach [Mochuda].&#160; Whatever credit therefore is due to
originating this work is Miss Hull's, and hers alone.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The editor's best thanks are due, and are hereby most
gratefully tendered, to Rev. M. Sheehan, D.D., D.Ph., Rev. Paul
Walsh, Rev. J. MacErlhean, S.J., M.A., as well as to Mr. R.
O'Foley, who, at much expense of time and labour, have carefully
read the proofs, and, with unselfish prodigality of their scholarly
resources, have made many valuable suggestions and corrections.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<h3><i>I.&#8212;GENERAL.</i></h3>
</center>
<p>A most distinctive class of ancient Irish literature, and
probably the class that is least popularly familiar, is the
hagiographical.&#160; It is, the present writer ventures to submit, as
valuable as it is distinctive and as well worthy of study as it is
neglected.&#160; While annals, tales and poetry have found editors the
Lives of Irish Saints have remained largely a mine unworked.&#160;
Into the causes of this strange neglect it is not the purpose of
the present introduction to enter.&#160; Suffice it to glance in
passing at one of the reasons which has been alleged in
explanation, scil.:&#8212;that the "Lives" are uncritical and
romantic, that they abound in wild legends, chronological
impossibilities and all sorts of incredible stories, and, finally,
that miracles are multiplied till the miraculous becomes the
ordinary, and that marvels are magnified till the narrative borders
on the ludicrous.&#160; The Saint as he is sketched is sometimes a
positively repulsive being&#8212;arrogant, venomous, and cruel; he
demands two eyes or more for one, and, pucklike, fairly revels in
mischief!&#160; As painted he is in fact more a pagan deity than a
Christian man.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The foregoing charges may, or must, be admitted
partially or in full, but such admission implies no denial of the
historical value of the Lives.&#160; All archaic literature, be it
remembered, is in a greater or less degree uncritical, and it must
be read in the light of the writer's times and surroundings.&#160;
That imagination should sometimes run riot and the pen be carried
beyond the boundary line of the strictly literal is perhaps nothing
much to be marvelled at in the case of the supernatural minded Celt
with religion for his theme.&#160; Did the scribe believe what he
wrote when he recounted the multiplied marvels of his holy patron's
life?&#160; Doubtless he did&#8212;and why not!&#160; To the
unsophisticated monastic and mediaeval mind, as to the mind of
primitive man, the marvellous and supernatural is almost as real
and near as the commonplace and natural.&#160; If anyone doubts this
let him study the mind of the modern Irish peasant; let him get
beneath its surface and inside its guardian ring of shrinking
reserve; there he will find the same material exactly as composed
the mind of the tenth century biographers of Declan and Mochuda.&#160;
Dreamers and visionaries were of as frequent occurrence in Erin of
ages ago as they are to-day.&#160; Then as now the supernatural and
marvellous had a wondrous fascination for the Celtic mind.&#160;
Sometimes the attraction becomes so strong as seemingly to
overbalance the faculty of distinguishing fact from fancy.&#160; Of
St. Bridget we are gravely told that to dry her wet cloak she hung
in out on a sunbeam!&#160; Another Saint sailed away to a foreign land
on a sod from his native hillside!&#160; More than once we find a
flagstone turned into a raft to bear a missionary band beyond the
seas!&#160; St. Fursey exchanged diseases with his friend Magnentius,
and, stranger still, the exchange was arranged and effected by
correspondence!&#160; To the saints moreover are ascribed lives of
incredible duration&#8212;to Mochta, Ibar, Seachnal, and Brendan,
for instance, three hundred years each; St. Mochaemog is credited
with a life of four hundred and thirteen years, and so on!</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Clan, or tribe, rivalry was doubtless one of the things
which made for the invention and multiplication of miracles.&#160; If
the patron of the Decies is credited with a miracle, the tribesmen
of Ossory must go one better and attribute to their tribal saint a
marvel more striking still.&#160; The hagiographers of Decies retort
for their patron by a claim of yet another miracle and so on.&#160; It
is to be feared too that occasionally a less worthy motive than
tribal honour prompted the imagination of our Irish
hagiographers&#8212;the desire to exploit the saint and his honour
for worldly gain.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The "Lives" of the Irish Saints contain an immense
quantity of material of first rate importance for the historian of
the Celtic church.&#160; Underneath the later concoction of fable is a
solid substratum of fact which no serious student can ignore.&#160;
Even where the narrative is otherwise plainly myth or fiction it
sheds many a useful sidelight on ancient manners, customs and laws
as well as on the curious and often intricate operations of the
Celtic mind.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; By "Lives" are here meant the old MS. biographies which
have come down to us from ages before the invention of printing.&#160;
Sometimes these "Lives" are styled "Acts."&#160; Generally we have
only one standard "Life" of a saint and of this there are usually
several copies, scattered in various libraries and collections.&#160;
Occasionally a second Life is found differing essentially from the
first, but, as a rule, the different copies are only recensions of
a single original.&#160; Some of the MSS. are parchment but the
majority are in paper; some Lives again are merely fragments and no
doubt scores if not hundreds of others have been entirely lost.&#160;
Of many hundreds of our Irish saints we have only the meagre
details supplied by the martyrologies, with perhaps occasional
reference to them in the Lives of other saints.&#160; Again, finally,
the memory of hundreds and hundreds of saints additional survives
only in place names or is entirely lost.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; There still survive probably over a hundred
"Lives"&#8212;possibly one hundred and fifty; this, however, does
not imply that therefore we have Lives of one hundred or one
hundred and fifty saints, for many of the saints whose Acts survive
have really two sets of the latter&#8212;one in Latin and the other
in Irish; moreover, of a few of the Latin Lives and of a larger
number of the Irish Lives we have two or more recensions.&#160; There
are, for instance, three independent Lives of St. Mochuda and one
of these is in two recensions.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The surviving Lives naturally divide themselves into two
great classes&#8212;the Latin Lives and the Irish,&#8212;written in
Latin and Irish respectively.&#160; We have a Latin Life only of some
saints, and Irish Life only of others, and of others again we have
a Latin Life and an Irish.&#160; It may be necessary to add the Acts
which have been translated into Latin by Colgan or the Bollandists
do not of course rank as Latin Lives.&#160; Whether the Latin Lives
proper are free translations of the Irish Lives or the Irish Lives
translations of Latin originals remains still, to a large extent,
an open question.&#160; Plummer (<i>"Vitae SSm. Hib.," Introd.</i>)
seems to favour the Latin Lives as the originals.&#160; His reasoning
here however leaves one rather unconvinced.&#160; This is not the
place to go into the matter at length, but a new bit of evidence
which makes against the theory of Latin originals may be quoted; it
is furnished by the well known collection of Latin Lives known as
the Codex Salmanticensis, to which are appended brief marginal
notes in mixed middle Irish and Latin.&#160; One such note to the Life
of St. Cuangus of Lismore (<i>recte</i> Liathmore) requests a
prayer for him who has translated the Life out of the Irish into
Latin.&#160; If one of the Lives, and this a typical or characteristic
Life, be a translation, we may perhaps assume that the others, or
most of them, are translations also.&#160; In any case we may assume
as certain that there were original Irish materials or data from
which the formal Lives (Irish or Latin) were compiled.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The Latin Lives are contained mainly in four great
collections.&#160; The first and probably the most important of these
is in the Royal Library at Brussels, included chiefly in a large
MS. known as <i>Codex Salmanticensis</i> from the fact that it
belonged in the seventeenth century to the Irish College of
Salamanca.&#160; The second collection is in Marsh's Library, Dublin,
and the third in Trinity College Library.&#160; The two latter may for
practical purposes be regarded as one, for they are sister
MSS.&#8212;copied from the same original.&#160; The Marsh's Library
collection is almost certainly, <i>teste</i> Plummer, the document
referred to by Colgan as Codex Kilkenniensis and it is quite
certainly the Codex Ardmachanus of Fleming.&#160; The fourth
collection (or the third, if we take as one the two last
mentioned,) is in the Bodleian at Oxford amongst what are known as
the Rawlinson MSS.&#160; Of minor importance, for one reason or
another, are the collections of the Franciscan Library, Merchants'
Quay, Dublin, and in Maynooth College respectively.&#160; The first of
the enumerated collections was published <i>in extenso,</i> about
twenty-five years since, by the Marquis of Bute, while recently the
gist of all the Latin collections has been edited with rare
scholarship by Rev. Charles Plummer of Oxford.&#160; Incidentally may
be noted the one defect in Mr. Plummer's great work&#8212;its
author's almost irritating insistence on pagan origins, nature
myths, and heathen survivals.&#160; Besides the Marquis of Bute and
Plummer, Colgan and the Bollandists have published some Latin
Lives, and a few isolated "Lives" have been published from time to
time by other more or less competent editors.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The Irish Lives, though more numerous than the Latin,
are less accessible.&#160; The chief repertorium of the former is the
Burgundian or Royal Library, Brussels.&#160; The MS. collection at
Brussels appears to have originally belonged to the Irish
Franciscans of Louvain and much of it is in the well-known
handwriting of Michael O'Clery.&#160; There are also several
collections of Irish Lives in Ireland&#8212;in the Royal Irish
Academy, for instance, and Trinity College Libraries.&#160; Finally,
there are a few Irish Lives at Oxford and Cambridge, in the British
Museum, Marsh's Library, &amp;c., and in addition there are many
Lives in private hands.&#160; In this connection it can be no harm,
and may do some good, to note that an apparently brisk, if
unpatriotic, trade in Irish MSS. (including of course "Lives" of
Saints) is carried on with the United States.&#160; Wealthy, often
ignorant, Irish-Americans, who are unable to read them, are making
collections of Irish MSS. and rare Irish books, to Ireland's
loss.&#160; Some Irish MSS. too, including Lives of Saints, have been
carried away as mementoes of the old land by departing
emigrants.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The date or period at which the Lives (Latin and Irish)
were written is manifestly, for half a dozen good reasons, a
question of the utmost importance to the student of the subject.&#160;
Alas, that the question has to some extent successfully defied
quite satisfactory solution.&#160; We can, so far, only
conjecture&#8212;though the probabilities seem strong and the
grounds solid.&#160; The probabilities are that the Latin Lives date
as a rule from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when they were
put into something like their present form for reading (perhaps in
the refectory) in the great religious houses.&#160; They were copied
and re-copied during the succeeding centuries and the scribes
according to their knowledge, devotion or caprice made various
additions, subtractions and occasional multiplications.&#160; The
Irish Lives are almost certainly of a somewhat earlier date than
the Latin and are based partly (<i>i.e.</i> as regards the bulk of
the miracles) on local tradition, and partly (<i>i.e.</i> as
regards the purely historical element) on the authority of written
materials.&#160; They too were, no doubt, copied and interpolated much
as were the Latin Lives.&#160; The present copies of Irish Lives date
as a rule from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries only, and
the fact that the Latin and the Irish Life (where there is this
double biography) sometimes agree very perfectly may indicate that
the Latin translation or Life is very late.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The chief published collections of Irish Saints' Lives
may be set down as seven, scil.:&#8212;five in Latin and one each
in Irish and English.&#160; The Latin collections are the
Bollandists', Colgan's, Messingham's, Fleming's, and Plummer's; the
Irish collection is Stokes' (<i>"Lives of Saints from the Book of
Lismore"</i>) and the English is of course O'Hanlon's.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Most striking, probably, of the characteristics of the
"Lives" is their very evident effort to exalt and glorify the saint
at any cost.&#160; With this end of glorification in view the
hagiographer is prepared to swallow everything and record
anything.&#160; He has, in fact, no critical sense and possibly he
would regard possession of such a sense as rather an evil thing and
use of it as irreverent.&#160; He does not, as a consequence, succeed
in presenting us with a very life-like or convincing portrait of
either the man or the saint.&#160; Indeed the saint, as drawn in the
Lives, is, as already hinted, a very unsaintlike
individual&#8212;almost as ready to curse as to pray and certainly
very much more likely to smite the aggressor than to present to him
the other cheek.&#160; In the text we shall see St. Mochuda, whose
Life is a specially sane piece of work, cursing on the same
occasion, first, King Blathmac and the Prince of Cluain, then, the
rich man Cronan who sympathised with the eviction, next an
individual named Dubhsulach who winked insolently at him, and
finally the people of St. Columba's holy city of Durrow who had
stirred up hostile feeling against him.&#160; Even gentle female
saints can hurl an imprecation too.&#160; St. Laisrech, for instance,
condemned the lands of those who refused her tribute,
to&#8212;nettles, elder shrub, and corncrakes!&#160; It is pretty
plain that the compilers of the lives had some prerogatives, claims
or rights to uphold&#8212;hence this frequent insistence on the
evil of resisting the Saint and presumably his successors.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; One characteristic of the Irish ascetics appears very
clear through all the exaggeration and all the biographical
absurdity; it is their spirit of intense mortification.&#160; To
understand this we have only to study one of the ancient Irish
Monastic Rules or one of the Irish Penitentials as edited by
D'Achery (<i>"Spicilegium"</i>) or Wasserschleben (<i>"Irische
Kanonensamerlung"</i>).&#160; Severest fasting, unquestioning
obedience and perpetual self renunciation were inculcated by the
Rules and we have ample evidence that they were observed with
extraordinary fidelity.&#160; The Rule of Maelruin absolutely forbade
the use of meat or of beer.&#160; Such a prohibition a thousand years
ago was an immensely more grievous thing than it would sound
to-day.&#160; Wheaten bread might partially supply the place of meat
to-day, but meat was easier to procure than bread in the eighth
century.&#160; Again, a thousand years ago, tea or coffee there was
none and even milk was often difficult or impossible to procure in
winter.&#160; So severe in fact was the fast that religious sometimes
died of it.&#160; Bread and water being found insufficient to sustain
life and health, gruel was substituted in some monasteries and of
this monastic gruel there were three varieties:&#8212;(<i>a</i>)
"gruel upon water" in which the liquid was so thick that the meal
reached the surface, (<i>b</i>) "gruel between two waters" in which
the meal, while it did not rise to the surface, did not quite fall
to the bottom, and (<i>c</i>) "gruel under water" which was so weak
and so badly boiled that he meal easily fell to the bottom.&#160; In
the case of penitents the first brand of gruel was prescribed for
light offences, the second kind for sins of ordinary gravity, and
the "gruel under water" for extraordinary crimes (<i>vid.</i>
Messrs. Gwynne and Purton on the Rule of Maelruin, &amp;c.)&#160; The
most implicit, exact and prompt obedience was prescribed and
observed.&#160; An overseer of Mochuda's monastery at Rahen had
occasion to order by name a young monk called Colman to do
something which involved his wading into a river.&#160; Instantly a
dozen Colmans plunged into the water.&#160; Instances of extraordinary
penance abound, beside which the austerities of Simon Stylites
almost pale.&#160; The Irish saints' love of solitude was also a very
marked characteristic.&#160; Desert places and solitary islands of the
ocean possessed an apparently wonderful fascination for them.&#160;
The more inaccessible or forbidding the island the more it was in
request as a penitential retreat.&#160; There is hardly one of the
hundred islands around the Irish coast which, one time or another,
did not harbour some saint or solitary upon its rocky bosom.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The testimony of the "Lives" to the saints' love and
practice of prayer is borne out by the evidence of more trustworthy
documents.&#160; Besides private prayers, the whole psalter seems to
have been recited each day, in three parts of fifty psalms each.&#160;
In addition, an immense number of Pater Nosters was prescribed.&#160;
The office and prayers were generally pretty liberally interspersed
with genuflexions or prostrations, of which a certain anchorite
performed as many as seven hundred daily.&#160; Another penitential
action which accompanied prayer was the <i>cros-figul.</i>&#160; This
was an extension of the arms in the shape of a cross; if anyone
wants to know how difficult a practice this is let him try it for,
say, fifteen minutes.&#160; Regarding recitation of the Divine Office
it was of counsel, and probably of precept, that is should not be
from memory merely, but that the psalms should all be read.&#160; For
this a good reason was given by Maelruin, <i>i.e.</i> that the
recitation might engage the eye as well as the tongue and
thought.&#160; An Irish homily refers to the mortification of the
saints and religious of the time as martyrdom, of which it
distinguishes three kinds&#8212;red, white, and blue.&#160; Red
martyrdom was death for the faith; white martyrdom was the
discipline of fasting, labour and bodily austerities; while blue
martyrdom was abnegation of the will and heartfelt sorrow for
sin.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; One of the puzzles of Irish hagiology is the great age
attributed to certain saints&#8212;periods of two hundred, three
hundred, and even four hundred years.&#160; Did the original compilers
of the Life intend this?&#160; Whatever the full explanation be the
writers of the Lives were clearly animated by a desire to make
their saint cotemporary and, if possible, a disciple, of one or
other of the great monastic founders, or at any rate to prove him a
pupil of one of the great schools of Erin.&#160; There was special
anxiety to connect the saint with Bangor or Clonard.&#160; To effect
the connection in question it was sometimes necessary to carry the
life backwards, at other times to carry it forwards, and
occasionally to lengthen it both backwards and forwards.&#160; Dr.
Chas. O'Connor gives a not very convincing explanation of the
three-hundred-year "Lives," scil.:&#8212;that the saint lived in
three centuries&#8212;during the whole of one century and in the
end and beginning respectively of the preceding and succeeding
centuries.&#160; This explanation, even if satisfactory for the
three-hundred-year Lives, would not help at all towards the Lives
of four hundred years.&#160; A common explanation is that the scribe
mistook numerals in the MS. before him and wrote the wrong
figures.&#160; There is no doubt that copying is a fruitful source of
error as regards numerals.&#160; It is much more easy to make a
mistake in a numeral than in a letter; the context will enable one
to correct the letter, while it will give him no clue as regards a
numeral.&#160; On the subject of the alleged longevity of Irish Saints
Anscombe has recently been elaborating in <i>Eriu</i> a new and
very ingenious theory.&#160; Somewhat unfortunately the author happens
to be a rather frequent propounder of ingenious theories.&#160; His
explanation is briefly&#8212;the use and confusion of different
systems of chronology.&#160; He alleges that the original writers used
what is called the Diocletian Era or the "Era of the Martyrs" as
the <i>terminus a quo</i> of their chronological system and, in
support of his position, he adduces the fact that this, which was
the most ancient of all ecclesiastical eras, was the era used by
the schismatics in Britain and that it was introduced by St.
Patrick.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; As against the contradiction, anachronisms and
extravagances of the Lives we have to put the fact that generally
speaking the latter corroborate one another, and that they receive
extern corroboration from the annals.&#160; Such disagreements as
occur are only what one would expect to find in documents dealing
with times so remote.&#160; To the credit side too must go the fact
that references to Celtic geography and to local history are all as
a rule accurate.&#160; Of continental geography and history however
the writers of the Lives show much ignorance, but scarcely quite as
much as the corresponding ignorance shown by Continental writers
about Ireland.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The missionary methods of the early Irish Church and its
monastic or semi-monastic system are frequently referred to as
peculiar, if not unique.&#160; A missionary system more or less
similar must however have prevailed generally in that age.&#160; What
other system could have been nearly as successful amongst a pagan
people circumstanced as the Irish were?&#160; The community system
alone afforded the necessary mutual encouragement and protection to
the missionaries.&#160; Each monastic station became a base of
operations.&#160; The numerous diminutive dioceses, quasi-dioceses, or
tribal churches, were little more than extensive parishes and the
missionary bishops were little more in jurisdiction than glorified
parish priests.&#160; The bishop's <i>muintir,</i> that is the members
of his household, were his assistant clergy.&#160; Having converted
the chieftain or head of the tribe the missionary had but to
instruct and baptise the tribesmen and to erect churches for
them.&#160; Land and materials for the church were provided by the
Clan or the Clan's head, and lands for support of the missioner or
of the missionary community were allotted just as they had been
previously allotted to the pagan priesthood; in fact there can be
but little doubt that the lands of the pagan priests became in many
cases the endowment of the Christian establishment.&#160; It is not
necessary, by the way, to assume that the Church in Ireland as
Patrick left it, was formally monastic.&#160; The clergy lived in
community, it is true, but it was under a somewhat elastic rule,
which was really rather a series of Christian and Religious
counsels.&#160; A more formal monasticism had developed by the time of
Mochuda; this was evidently influenced by the spread of St.
Benedict's Rule, as Patrick's quasi-monasticism, nearly two
centuries previously, had been influenced by Pachomius and St.
Basil, through Lerins.&#160; The real peculiarity in Ireland was that
when the community-missionary-system was no longer necessary it was
not abandoned as in other lands but was rather developed and
emphasised.</p>

<h3><i>II.&#8212;ST. DECLAN.</i></h3>
</center>
<blockquote><font size="-1">"If thou hast the right, O Erin, to a
champion of battle to aid thee thou hast the head of a hundred
thousand, Declan of Ardmore."&#160; <cite>(Martyrology of
Oengus).</cite></font></blockquote>
<p>Five miles or less to the east of Youghal Harbour, on the
southern Irish coast, a short, rocky and rather elevated promontory
juts, with a south-easterly trend, into the ocean.&#160; Maps and
admiralty charts call it Ram
Head, but the real name is Ceann-a-Rama and popularly it is often
styled Ardmore Head.&#160; The material of this inhospitable coast is
a hard metamorphic schist which bids defiance to time and
weather.&#160; Landwards the shore curves in clay cliffs to the
north-east, leaving, between it and the iron headland beyond, a
shallow exposed bay wherein many a proud ship has met her doom.&#160;
Nestling at the north side of the headland and sheltered by the
latter from Atlantic storms stands one of the most remarkable
groups of ancient ecclesiastical remains in Ireland&#8212;all that
has survived of St. Declan's holy city of Ardmore.&#160; This embraces
a beautiful and perfect round tower, a singularly interesting
ruined church commonly called the cathedral, the ruins of a second
church beside a holy well, a primitive oratory, a couple of ogham
inscribed pillar stones, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; No Irish saint perhaps has so strong a local hold as
Declan or has left so abiding a popular memory.&#160; Nevertheless his
period is one of the great disputed questions of early Irish
history.&#160; According to the express testimony of his Life,
corroborated by testimony of the Lives of SS. Ailbhe and Ciaran, he
preceded St. Patrick in the Irish mission and was a co-temporary of
the national apostle.&#160; Objection, exception or opposition to the
theory of Declan's early period is based less on any inherent
improbability in the theory itself than on contradictions and
inconsistencies in the Life.&#160; Beyond any doubt the Life does
actually contradict itself; it makes Declan a cotemporary of
Patrick in the fifth century and a cotemporary likewise of St.
David a century later.&#160; In any attempted solution of the
difficulty involved it may be helpful to remember a special motive
likely to animate a tribal histrographer, scil.:&#8212;the family
relationship, if we may so call it, of the two saints; David was
bishop of the Deisi colony in Wales as Declan was bishop of their
kinsmen of southern Ireland.&#160; It was very probably part of the
writer's purpose to call attention to the links of kindred which
bound the separated Deisi; witness his allusion later to the
alleged visit of Declan to his kinsmen of Bregia.&#160; Possibly there
were several Declans, as there were scores of Colmans, Finians,
&amp;c., and hence perhaps the confusion and some of the apparent
inconsistencies.&#160; There was certainly a second Declan, a disciple
of St. Virgilius, to whom the latter committed care of a church in
Austria where he died towards close of eighth century.&#160; Again we
find mention of a St. Declan who was a foster son of Mogue of
Ferns, and so on.&#160; It is too much, as Delehaye (<i>"Legendes
Hagiographiques"</i>) remarks, to expect the populace to
distinguish between namesakes.&#160; Great men are so rare!&#160; Is it
likely there should have lived two saints of the same name in the
same country!</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The latest commentators on the question of St. Declan's
period&#8212;and they happen to be amongst the most
weighty&#8212;argue strongly in favour of the pre-Patrician mission
(<i>Cfr.</i> Prof. Kuno Meyer, <i>"Learning Ireland in the Fifth
Century"</i>).&#160; Discussing the <i>way</i> in which letters first
reached our distant island of the west and the <i>causes</i> which
led to the proficiency of sixth-century Ireland in classical
learning Zimmer and Meyer contend that the seeds of that literary
culture, which flourished in Ireland of the sixth century, had been
sown therein in the first and second decades of the preceding
century by Gaulish scholars who had fled from their own country
owing to invasion of the latter by Goths and other barbarians.&#160;
The fact that these scholars, who were mostly Christians, sought
asylum in Ireland indicates that Christianity had already
penetrated thither, or at any rate that it was known and tolerated
there.&#160; Dr. Meyer answers the objection that if so large and so
important an invasion of scholars took place we ought have some
reference to the fact in the Irish annals.&#160; The annals, he
replies, are of local origin and they rarely refer in their oldest
parts to national events:&#160; moreover they are very meagre in their
information about the fifth century.&#160; One Irish reference to the
Gaulish scholars is, however, adduced in corroboration; it occurs
in that well known passage in St. Patrick's "Confessio" where the
saint cries out against certain "rhetoricians" in Ireland who were
hostile to him and pagan,&#8212;"You rhetoricians who do not know
the Lord, hear and search Who it was that called me up, fool though
I be, from the midst of those who think themselves wise and skilled
in the law and mighty orators and powerful in everything."&#160; Who
were these "rhetorici" that have made this passage so difficult for
commentators and have caused so various constructions to be put
upon it?&#160; It is clear, the professor maintains, that the
reference is to pagan rhetors from Gaul whose arrogant presumption,
founded on their learning, made them regard with disdain the
comparatively illiterate apostle of the Scots.&#160; Everyone is
familiar with the classic passage of Tacitus wherein he alludes to
the harbours of Ireland as being more familiar to continental
mariners than those of Britain.&#160; We have references moreover to
refugee Christians who fled to Ireland from the persecutions of
Diocletian more than a century before St. Patrick's day; in
addition it is abundantly evident that many
Irishmen&#8212;Christians like Celestius the lieutenant of
Pelagius, and possibly Pelagius himself, amongst them&#8212;had
risen to distinction or notoriety abroad before middle of the fifth
century.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Possibly the best way to present the question of
Declan's age is to put in tabulated form the arguments of the
pre-Patrician advocates against the counter contentions of those
who claim that Declan's period is later than Patrick's:&#8212;</p>

</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; In this matter and at this hour it is hardly worth
appealing to the authority of Lanigan and the scholars of the
past.&#160; Much evidence not available in Lanigan's day is now at the
service of scholars.&#160; We are to look rather at the reasoning of
Colgan, Ussher, and Lanigan than to the mere weight of their
names.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Referring in order to our tabulated grounds of argument,
<i>pro</i> and <i>con,</i> and taking the <i>pro</i> arguments
first, we may (I.) discard as evidence for our purpose the Life of
St. Ibar which is very fragmentary and otherwise a rather
unsatisfactory document.&#160; The Lives of Ailbhe, Ciaran, and Declan
are however mutually corroborative and consistent.&#160; The Roman
visit and the alleged tutelage under Hilarius are probably
embellishments; they look like inventions to explain something and
they may contain more than a kernel of truth.&#160; At any rate they
are matters requiring further investigation and elucidation.&#160; In
this connection it may be useful to recall that the Life (Latin) of
St. Ciaran has been attributed by Colgan to Evinus the disciple and
panegyrist of St. Patrick.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Patrick's apparent neglect of the Decies (II.) may have
no special significance.&#160; At best it is but negative evidence:&#160;
taken, however, in connection with (I.) and its consectaria it is
suggestive.&#160; We can hardly help speculating why the
apostle&#8212;passing as it were by its front door&#8212;should
have given the go-bye to a region so important as the Munster
Decies.&#160; Perhaps he sent preachers into it; perhaps there was no
special necessity for a formal mission, as the faith had already
found entrance.&#160; It is a little noteworthy too that we do not
find St. Patrick's name surviving in any ecclesiastical connection
with the Decies, if we except Patrick's Well, near Clonmel, and
this Well is within a mile or so of the territorial frontier.&#160;
Moreover the southern portion of the present Tipperary County had
been ceded by Aengus to the Deisi, only just previous to Patrick's
advent, and had hardly yet had sufficient time to become
absorbed.&#160; The whole story of Declan's alleged relations with
Patrick undoubtedly suggests some irregularity in Declan's
mission&#8212;an irregularity which was capable of rectification
through Patrick and which <i>de facto</i> was finally so
rectified.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; (III.) No one in Eastern Munster requires to be told how
strong is the cult of St. Declan throughout Decies and the adjacent
territory.&#160; It is hardly too much to say that the Declan
tradition in Waterford and Cork is a spiritual actuality,
extraordinary and unique, even in a land which till recently paid
special popular honour to its local saints.&#160; In traditional
popular regard Declan in the Decies has ever stood first, foremost,
and pioneer.&#160; Carthage, founder of the tribal see, has held and
holds in the imagination of the people only a secondary place.&#160;
Declan, whencesoever or whenever he came, is regarded as the
spiritual father to whom the Deisi owe the gift of faith.&#160; How
far this tradition and the implied belief in Declan's priority and
independent mission are derived from circulation of the "Life"
throughout Munster in the last few centuries it is difficult to
gauge, but the tradition seems to have flourished as vigorously in
the days of Colgan as it does to-day.&#160; Declan's "pattern" at
Ardmore continues to be still the most noted celebration of its
kind in Ireland.&#160; A few years ago it was participated in by as
many as fourteen thousand people from all parts of Waterford, Cork,
and Tipperary.&#160; The scenes and ceremonies have been so frequently
described that it is not necessary to recount them
here&#8212;suffice it to say that the devotional practices and, in
fact, the whole celebration is of a purely popular character
receiving no approbation, and but bare toleration, from church or
clergy.&#160; Even to the present day Declan's name is borne as their
pr&#230;nomen by hundreds of Waterford men, and, before
introduction of the modern practice of christening with foolish
foreign names, its use was far more common, as the ancient
baptismal registers of Ardmore, Old Parish, and Clashmore
attest.&#160; On the other hand Declan's name is associated with
comparatively few places in the Decies.&#160; Of these the best known
is Relig Deaglain, a disused graveyard and early church site on the
townland of Drumroe, near Cappoquin.&#160; There was also an ancient
church called Killdeglain, near Stradbally.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Against the theory of the pre-Patrician or
citra-Patrician mission we have first the objection, which really
has no weight, and which we shall not stop to discuss, that it is
impossible for Christianity at that early date to have found its
way to this distant island, beyond the boundary of the world.&#160; An
argument on a different plane is (I.), the undoubtedly
contradictory and inconsistent character of the Life.&#160; It is easy
however to exaggerate the importance of this point.&#160; Modern
critical methods were undreamed of in the days of our hagiographer,
who wrote, moreover, for edification only in a credulous age.&#160;
Most of the historical documents of the period are in a greater or
less degree uncritical but that does not discredit their testimony
however much it may confuse their editors.&#160; It can be urged
moreover that two mutually incompatible genealogies of the saint
are given.&#160; The genealogy given by MacFirbisigh seems in fact to
disagree in almost every possible detail with the genealogy in 23
M. 50 R.I.A.&#160; That however is like an argument that Declan never
existed.&#160; It really suggests and almost postulates the existence
of a second Declan whose Acts and those of <i>our</i> Declan have
become mutually confused.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; (II.) Absence of Declan's name from the Acts of Patrick
is a negative argument.&#160; It is explicable perhaps by the supposed
irregularity of Declan's preaching.&#160; Declan was certainly earlier
than Mochuda and yet there is no reference to him in the Life of
the latter saint.&#160; Ailbhe however is referred to in the
Tripartite Life of Patrick and the cases of Ailbhe and Declan are
<i>a pari;</i> the two saints stand or fall together.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; (IV.) Motives for invention of the pre-Patrician myth
are alleged, scil.:&#8212;to rebut certain claims to jurisdiction,
tribute or visitation advanced by Armagh in after ages.&#160; It is
hard to see however how resistance to the claims in question could
be better justified on the theory of a pre-Patrician Declan, who
admittedly acknowledged Patrick's supremacy, than on the admission
of a post-Patrician mission.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; That in Declan we have to deal with a very early
Christian teacher of the Decies there can be no doubt.&#160; If not
anterior to Patrick he must have been the latter's cotemporary.&#160;
Declan however had failed to convert the chieftain of his race and
for this&#8212;reading between the lines of the "Life"&#8212;we
seem to hear Patrick blaming him.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The monuments proper of Declan remaining at Ardmore are
(<i>a</i>) his <i>oratory</i> near the Cathedral and Round Tower in
the graveyard, (<i>b</i>) his <i>stone</i> on the beach, (<i>c</i>)
his <i>well</i> on the cliff, and (<i>d</i>) <i>another stone</i>
said to have been found in his tomb and preserved at Ardmore for
long ages with great reveration.&#160; The "Life" refers moreover to
the saint's pastoral staff and his bell but these have disappeared
for centuries.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The "Oratory" is simply a primitive church of the usual
sixth century type:&#160; it stands 13' 4" x 8' 9" in the clear, and
has, or had, the usual high-pitched gables and square-headed west
doorway with inclining jambs.&#160; Another characteristic feature of
the early oratory is seen in the curious antae or prolongation of
the side walls.&#160; Locally the little building is known as the
<i>beannac&#225;n,</i> in allusion, most likely, to its high gables
or the finials which once, no doubt, in Irish fashion, adorned its
roof.&#160; Though somewhat later than Declan's time this primitive
building is very intimately connected with the Saint.&#160; Popularly
it is supposed to be his grave and within it is a hollow space
scooped out, wherein it is said his ashes once reposed.&#160; It is
highly probable that tradition is quite correct as to the saint's
grave, over which the little church was erected in the century
following Declan's death.&#160; The oratory was furnished with a roof
of slate by Bishop Mills in 1716.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; "St. Declan's Stone" is a glacial boulder of very hard
conglomerate which lies on a rocky ledge of beach beneath the
village of Ardmore.&#160; It measures some 8' 6" x 4' 6" x 4' 0" and
reposes upon two slightly jutting points of the underlying
metamorphic rock.&#160; Wonderful virtues are attributed to St.
Declan's Stone, which, on the occasion of the patronal feast, is
visited by hundreds of devotees who, to participate in its healing
efficacy and beneficence, crawl laboriously on face and hands
through the narrow space between the boulder and the underlying
rock.&#160; Near by, at foot of a new storm-wall, are two similar but
somewhat smaller boulders which, like their venerated and more
famous neighbour, were all wrenched originally by a glacier from
their home in the Comeragh Mountains twenty miles away.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; "St. Declan's Well," beside some remains of a rather
large and apparently twelfth century church on the cliff, in the
townland of Dysert is diverted into a shallow basin in which
pilgrims bathe feet and hands.&#160; Set in some comparatively modern
masonry over the well are a carved crucifixion and other figures of
apparently late mediaeval character.&#160; Some malicious interference
with this well led, nearly a hundred years since, to much popular
indignation and excitement.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The second "St. Declan's Stone" was a small,
cross-inscribed jet-black piece of slate or marble,
approximately&#8212;2" or 3" x 1&#189;".&#160; Formerly it seems to
have had a small silver cross inset and was in great demand locally
as an amulet for cattle curing.&#160; It disappeared however, some
fifty years or so since, but very probably it could still be
recovered in Dungarvan.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Far the most striking of all the monuments at Ardmore
is, of course, the Round Tower which, in an excellent state of
preservation, stands with its conical cap of stone nearly a hundred
feet high.&#160; Two remarkable, if not unique, features of the tower
are the series of sculptured corbels which project between the
floors on the inside, and the four projecting belts or zones of
masonry which divide the tower into storeys externally.&#160; The
tower's architectural anomalies are paralleled by its history which
is correspondingly unique:&#160; it stood a regular siege in 1642,
when ordnance was brought to bear on it and it was defended by
forty confederates against the English under Lords Dungarvan and
Broghil.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; A few yards to north of the Round Tower stands "The
Cathedral" illustrating almost every phase of ecclesiastical
architecture which flourished in Ireland from St. Patrick to the
Reformation&#8212;Cyclopean, Celtic-Romanesque, Transitional and
Pointed.&#160; The chancel arch is possibly the most remarkable and
beautiful illustration of the Transitional that we have.&#160; An
extraordinary feature of the church is the wonderful series of
Celtic arcades and panels filled with archaic sculptures in relief
which occupy the whole external face of the west gable.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; St. Declan's foundation at Ardmore seems (<i>teste</i>
Moran's Archdall) to have been one of the Irish religious houses
which accepted the reform of Pope Innocent at the Lateran Council
and to have transformed itself into a Regular Canonry.&#160; It would
however be possible to hold, on the evidence, that it degenerated
into a mere parochial church.&#160; We hear indeed of two or three
episcopal successors of the saint, scil.:&#8212;Ultan who
immediately followed him, Eugene who witnessed a charter to the
abbey of Cork in 1174, and Moelettrim &#212; Duibhe-rathre who died
in 1303 after he had, according to the annals of Inisfallen,
"erected and finished the Church" of Ardmore.&#160; The <i>"Wars of
the Gaedhil and Gall"</i> have reference, circa 824 or 825, to
plunder by the Northmen of Disert Tipraite which is almost
certainly the church of Dysert by the Holy Well at Ardmore.&#160; The
same fleet, on the same expedition, plundered Dunderrow (near
Kinsale), Inisshannon (Bandon River), Lismore, and Kilmolash.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Regarding the age of our "Life" it is difficult with the
data at hand to say anything very definite.&#160; While dogmatism
however is dangerous indefiniteness is unsatisfying.&#160; True, we
cannot trace the genealogy of the present version beyond middle of
the sixteenth century, but its references to ancient monuments
existing at date of its compilation show it to be many centuries
older.&#160; Its language proves little or nothing, for, being a
popular work, it would be modernised to date by each successive
scribe.&#160; Colgan was of opinion it was a composition of the eighth
century.&#160; Ussher and Ware, who had the Life in very ancient
codices, also thought it of great antiquity.&#160; Papebrach, the
Bollandist, on the other hand, considered the Life could not be
older than the twelfth century, but this opinion of his seems to
have been based on a misapprehension.&#160; In the absence of all
diocesan colour or allusion one feels constrained to assign the
production to some period previous to Rathbreasail.&#160; We should
not perhaps be far wrong in assigning the first collection of
materials to somewhere in the eighth century or in the century
succeeding.&#160; The very vigorous ecclesiastical revival of the
eleventh century, at conclusion of the Danish wars, must have led
to some revision of the country's religious literature.&#160; The
introduction, a century and-a-half later, of the great religious
orders most probably led to translation of the Life into Latin and
its casting into shape for reading in refectory or choir.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Only three surviving copies of the Irish Life are known
to the writer:&#160; one in the Royal Library at Brussels, the second
in the Royal Irish Academy Collection (M. 23, 50, pp. 109-120), and
the third in possession of Professor Hyde.&#160; As the second and
third enumerated are copies of one imperfect exemplar it has not
been thought necessary to collate both with the Brussels MS. which
has furnished the text here printed.&#160; M. 23, 50 (R.I.A.) has
however been so collated and the marginal references initialled B
are to that imperfect copy.&#160; The latter, by the way, is in the
handwriting of John Murphy "na Raheenach," and is dated 1740.&#160; It
has not been thought necessary to give more than the important
variants.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The present text is a reproduction of the Brussels MS.
plus lengthening of contractions.&#160; As regards lengthening in
question it is to be noted that the well known contraction for
<i>ea</i> or <i>e</i> has been uniformly transliterated
<i>e.</i>&#160; Otherwise orthography of the MS. has been scrupulously
followed&#8212;even where inconsistent or incorrect.&#160; For the
division into paragraphs the editor is not responsible; he has
merely followed the division originated, or adopted, by the
scribe.&#160; The Life herewith presented was copied in 1629 by
Brother Michael O'Clery of the Four Masters' staff from an older
MS. of Eochy O'Heffernan's dated 1582.&#160; The MS. of O'Heffernan is
referred to by our scribe as <i>seinleabar,</i> but his reference
is rather to the contents than to the copy.&#160; Apparently O'Clery
did more than transcribe; he re-edited, as was his wont, into the
literary Irish of his day.&#160; A page of the Brussels MS.,
reproduced in facsimile as a frontispiece to the present volume,
will give the student a good idea of O'Clery's script and
style.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Occasional notes on Declan in the martyrologies and
elsewhere give some further information about our saint.&#160;
Unfortunately however the alleged facts are not always capable of
reconciliation with statements of our "Life," and again the
existence of a second, otherwise unknown, Declan is suggested.&#160;
The introduction of rye is attributed to him in the Calendar of
Oengus, as introduction of wheat is credited to St. Finan Camm, and
introduction of bees to St. Modomnoc,&#8212;"It was the full of his
shoe that Declan brought, the full of his shoe likewise Finan, but
the full of his bell Modomnoc" (<i>Cal. Oeng.,</i> April 7th).&#160;
More puzzling is the note in the same Calendar which makes Declan a
foster son of Mogue of Ferns!&#160; This entry illustrates the way in
which errors originate.&#160; A former scribe inadvertently copied in,
after Declan's name, portion of the entry immediately following
which relates to Colman Hua Liathain.&#160; Successive scribes
re-copied the error without discovering it and so it became
stereotyped.</p>

<h3><i>III.&#8212;ST. MOCHUDA.</i></h3>
</center>
<blockquote><font size="-1">"It was he (Mochuda) that had the
famous congregation consisting of seven hundred and ten persons; an
angel used to address every third man of them.&#160;
<cite>(Martyrology of Donegal).</cite></font></blockquote>
<p>In some respects the Life of Mochuda here presented is in sharp
contrast to the corresponding Life of Declan.&#160; The former
document is in all essentials a very sober historical
narrative&#8212;accurate wherever we can test it, credible and
harmonious on the whole.&#160; Philologically, to be sure, it is of
little value,&#8212;certainly a much less valuable Life than
Declan's; historically, however (and question of the pre-Patrician
mission apart) it is immensely the more important document.&#160; On
one point do we feel inclined to quarrel with its author, scil.:&#160;
that he has not given us more specifically the motives underlying
Mochuda's expulsion from Rahen&#8212;one of the three worst
counsels ever given in Erin.&#160; Reading between his lines we spell,
jealousy&#8212;<i>invidia religiosorum.</i>&#160; Another jealousy too
is suggested&#8212;the mutual distrust of north and south which has
been the canker-worm of Irish political life for fifteen hundred
years, making intelligible if not justifying the indignation of a
certain distinguished Irishman who wanted to know the man's name,
in order to curse its owner, who first divided Ireland into two
provinces.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Three different Lives of Mochuda are known to the
present writer.&#160; Two of them are contained in a MS. at Brussels
(<i>C/r.</i> Bindon, p. 8, 13) and of one of these there is a copy
in a MS. of Dineen's in the Royal Irish Academy (Stowe Collection,
A. IV, I.)&#160; Dineen appears to have been a Cork or Kerry man and
to have worked under the patronage of the rather noted Franciscan
Father Francis Matthew (O'Mahony), who was put to death at Cork by
Inchiquin in 1644.&#160; The bald text of Dineen's "Life" was
published a few years since, without translation, in the <i>Irish
Rosary.</i>&#160; The corresponding Brussels copy is in Michael
O'Clery's familiar hand.&#160; In it occurs the strange
pagan-flavoured story of the British Monk Constantine.&#160; O'Clery's
copy was made in January, 1627, at the Friary of Drouish from the
Book of Tadhg O'Ceanan and it is immediately followed by a tract
entitled&#8212;<i>"Do Macaib Ua Suanac."</i>&#160; The bell of
Mochuda, by the way, which the saint rang against Blathmac, was
called the <i>glassan</i> of Hui Suanaig in later times.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The "Life" here printed, which follows the Latin Life so
closely that one seems a late translation of the other, is as far
as the editor is aware, contained in a single MS. only.&#160; This is
M. 23, 50, R.I.A., in the handwriting of John Murphy, "na
Raheenach."&#160; Murphy was a Co. Cork schoolmaster, scribe, and
poet, of whom a biographical sketch will be found prefixed by Mr.
R. A. Foley to a collection of Murphy's poems that he has
edited.&#160; The sobriquet, "na Raheenach," is really a kind of
tribal designation.&#160; The "Life" is very full but is in its
present form a comparatively late production; it was transcribed by
Murphy between 1740 and 1750.&#160; It is much to be regretted that
the scribe tells us nothing of his original.&#160; Murphy, but the
way, seems to have specialised to some extent in saint's Lives and
to have imbued his disciples with something of the same taste.&#160;
One of his pupils was Maurice O'Connor, a scribe and shipwright of
Cove, to whom we owe the Life of St. Ciaran of Saighir printed in
<i>"Silva Gadelica."</i>&#160; The reasons of choice for publication
here of the present Life are avowedly non-philological; the motive
for preference is that it is the longest of the three Lives and for
historical purposes the most important.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The Life presents considerable evidence of historical
reliability; its geography is detailed and correct; its references
to contemporaries of Mochuda are accurate on the whole and there
are few inconsistencies or none.&#160; Moreover it sheds some new
light on that chronic puzzle&#8212;organisation of the Celtic
Church of Ireland.&#160; Mochuda, head of a great monastery at Rahen,
is likewise a kind of pluralist Parish Priest with a parish in
Kerry, administered in his name by deputed ecclesiastics, and other
parishes similarly administered in Kerrycurrihy, Rostellan, West
Muskerry, and Spike Island, Co. Cork.&#160; When a chief parishioner
lies seriously ill in distant Corca Duibhne, Mochuda himself comes
all the way from the centre of Ireland to administer the last rites
to the dying man, and so on.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The relations of the people to the Church and its
ministers are in many respects not at all easy to understand.&#160;
Oblations, for instance, of themselves and their territory,
&amp;c., by chieftains are frequent.&#160; Oblations of monasteries
are made in a similar way.&#160; Probably this signifies no more than
that the chief region or monastery put itself under the saint's
jurisdiction or rule or both.&#160; That there were other churches too
than the purely monastic appears from offerings to Mochuda of
already existing churches, <i>v.g.</i> from the Clanna Ruadhan in
Decies, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Lismore, the most famous of Mochuda's foundations,
became within a century of the saint's death, one of the great
monastic schools of Erin, attracting to his halls, or rather to its
boothies, students from all Ireland and even&#8212;so it is
claimed&#8212;from lands beyond the seas.&#160; King Alfrid [Aldfrith]
of Northumbria, for instance, is said to have partaken of Lismore's
hospitality, and certainly Cormac of Cashel, Malachy and Celsus of
Armagh and many others of the most distinguished of the Scots
partook thereof.&#160; The roll of Lismore's calendared saints would
require, did the matter fall within our immediate province, more
than one page to itself.&#160; Some interesting reference to Mochuda
and his holy city occur in the Life of one of his disciples, St.
Colman Maic Luachain, edited for the R.I.A. by Professor Kuno
Meyer.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; There are many indications in the present Life that, at
one period, and in the time of Carthach, the western boundary of
Decies extended far beyond the line at present recognised.&#160;
Similar indications are furnished by the martyrologies, &amp;c.;
for instance, the martyrology of Donegal under November 28th
records of "the three sons of Bochra" that "they are of Archadh
Raithin in Ui Mic Caille in Deisi Mumhan" and Ibid, p. xxxvii, it
is stated <i>"i ccondae Corcaige ataid na Desi M&#250;man."</i>&#160;
Not only Imokilly but all Co. Cork, east of Queenstown [Cobh] and
north to the Blackwater, seems to have acknowledged Mochuda's
jurisdiction.&#160; At Rathbreasail accordingly (<i>teste</i> Keating,
on the authority of the Book of Cloneneigh) the Diocese of Lismore
is made to extend to Cork,&#8212;probably over the present baronies
of Imokilly, Kinatallon, and Barrymore.&#160; That part, at least, of
Condons and Clangibbon was likewise included is inferrible from the
fact that, as late as the sixteenth century visitations, Kilworth,
founded by Colman Maic Luachain, ranked as a parish in the diocese
of Lismore.&#160; Further evidence pointing in the same direction is
furnished by Clondulane, &amp;c., represented in the present Life
as within Carthach's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The Rule of St. Carthach is one of the few ancient Irish
so-called monastic Rules surviving.&#160; It is in reality less a
"rule," as the latter is now understood, than a series of Christian
and religious counsels drawn up by a spiritual master for his
disciples.&#160; It must not be understood from this that each
religious house did not have it formal regulations.&#160; The latter
however seem to have depended largely upon the abbot's spirit, will
or discretion.&#160; The existing "Rules" abound in allusions to
forgotten practices and customs and, to add to their obscurity,
their language is very difficult&#8212;sometimes, like the language
of the Brehon Laws, unintelligible.&#160; The rule ascribed to Mochuda
is certainly a document of great antiquity and may well have
emanated from the seventh century and from the author whose name it
bears.&#160; The tradition of Lismore and indeed of the Irish Church
is constant in attributing it to him.&#160; Copies of the Rule are
found in numerous MSS. but many of them are worthless owing to the
incompetence of the scribes to whom the difficult Irish of the text
was unintelligible.&#160; The text in the Leabhar Breac has been made
the basis of his edition of the Rule by <i>Mac Eaglaise,</i> a
writer in the <i>Irish Ecclesiastical Record</i> (1910).&#160; <i>Mac
Eaglaise's</i> edition, though it is not all that could be desired,
is far the most satisfactory which has yet appeared.&#160; Previous
editions of the Rule or part of it comprise one by Dr. Reeves in
his tract on the Culdees, one by Kuno Meyer in the <i>Gaelic
Journal</i> (<i>Vol. V.</i>) and another in <i>Archiv f&#252;r
C.L.</i> (3 <i>Bund.</i> 1905), and another again in <i>Eriu</i>
(<i>Vol.</i> 2, <i>p.</i> 172), besides a free translation of the
whole rule by O'Curry in the <i>I. R. Record</i> for 1864.&#160; The
text of the <i>Record</i> edition of 1910 is from Leabhar Breac
collated with other MSS.&#160; The order in the various copies is not
the same and some copies contain material which is wanting in
others.&#160; The "Rule" commences with the Ten Commandments, then it
enumerates the obligations respectively of bishops, abbots,
priests, monks, and culdees [anchorites].&#160; Finally there is a
section on the order of meals and on the refectory and another on
the obligations of a king.&#160; The following excerpt on the duties
of an abbot (<i>I. E. Record</i> translation) will illustrate the
style and spirit of the Rule:</p>
<center>"Of the Abbot of a Church.</center>
&#160; &#160; 1.&#8212;If you be the head man of a Church noble is the
power, better for you that you be just who take the heirship of the
king.<br />
&#160; &#160; 2.&#8212;If you are the head man of a Church noble is the
obligation, preservation of the rights of the Church from the small
to the great.<br />
&#160; &#160; 3.&#8212;What Holy Church commands preach then with
diligence; what you order to each one do it yourself.<br />
&#160; &#160; 4.&#8212;As you love your own soul love the souls of
all.&#160; Yours the magnification of every good [and] banishment of
every evil.<br />
&#160; &#160; 5.&#8212;Be not a candle under a bushel [Luke 11:33].&#160;
Your learning without a cloud over it.&#160; Yours the healing of
every host both strong and weak.<br />
&#160; &#160; 6.&#8212;Yours to judge each one according to grade and
according to deed; he will advise you at judgment before the king.
<center>.&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160;
&#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; .</center>
&#160; &#160; 10.&#8212;Yours to rebuke the foolish, to punish the hosts,
turning disorder into order [restraint] of the stubborn, obstinate,
wretched."
<p>&#160; &#160; Reservation of the Coarbship of Mochuda at Lismore in
favour of Kerrymen is an extremely curious if not unique
provision.&#160; How long it continued in force we do not know.&#160;
Probably it endured to the twelfth century and possibly the rule
was not of strict interpretation.&#160; Christian O'Connarchy, who was
bishop of Lismore in the twelfth century, is regarded as a native
of Decies, though the contrary is slightly suggested by his final
retirement to Kerry.&#160; The alleged prophecy concerning Kerry men
and the coarbship points to some rule, regulation or law of
Mochuda.</p>

"Principality of Decies.
To Illustrate Lives of Declan and Mochuda." /></center>

<hr width="50%" />
<center>
<h1>Life of St. Declan.</h1>
<h1><i>Betha Decclain.</i></h1>
</center>
1.&#160; The most blessed Bishop Declan of the most noble race of the
kings of Ireland, <i>i.e.,</i> the holy bishop who is called Declan
was of the most noble royal family of Ireland&#8212;a family which
held the sceptre and exacted tribute from all Ireland at Tara for
ages.&#160; Declan was by birth of noble blood as will appear from his
origin and genealogy, for it was from Eochaidh Feidhleach, the
powerful Ardrigh of Ireland for twelve years, that he sprang.&#160;
Eochaidh aforesaid, had three sons, scil.:&#8212;Breas, Nar, and
Lothola, who are called the three Finneavna; there reigned one
hundred and seven kings of their race and kindred before and after
them, <i>i.e.</i> of the race of Eremon, king of
Ireland,&#8212;before the introduction of Christianity and
since.&#160; These three youths lay one day with their own sister
Clothra, daughter of the same father, and she conceived of them.&#160;
The son she brought forth as a consequence of that intercourse was
marked by three red wavy lines which indicated his descent from the
three youths aforesaid.&#160; He was named Lugaidh Sriabhdearg from
the three lines [<i>sriabaib</i>] in question, and he was beautiful
to behold and of greater bodily strength in infancy than is usual
with children of his age.&#160; He commenced his reign as king of
Ireland the year in which Caius Caesar [Caligula] died and he
reigned for twenty-six years.&#160; His son was named Criomthan
Nianair who reigned but sixteen years.&#160; Criomthan's son was named
Fearadach Finnfechtnach whose son was Fiacha Finnolaidh whose son
again was Tuathal Teachtmhar.&#160; This Tuathal had a son Felimidh
Reachtmhar who had in turn three sons&#8212;Conn Ceadcathach,
Eochaidh Finn, and Fiacha Suighde.&#160; Conn was king of Ireland for
twenty years and the productiveness of crops and soil and of
dairies in the time of Conn are worthy of commemoration and of fame
to the end of time.&#160; Conn was killed in Magh Cobha by the
Ulstermen, scil.:&#8212;by Tiopruid Tireach and it is principally
his seed which has held the kingship of Ireland ever since.&#160;
Eochaidh Finn was second son to Felimidh Reachtmhar and he migrated
to the latter's province of Leinster, and it is in that province
his race and progeny have remained since then.&#160; They are called
Leinstermen, and there are many chieftains and powerful persons of
them in Leinster.&#160; Fiacha Suighde moreover, although he died
before he succeeded to the chief sovereignty, possessed land around
Tara.&#160; He left three sons&#8212;Ross, Oengus, and Eoghan who were
renowned for martial deeds&#8212;valiant and heroic in battle and
in conflict.&#160; Of the three, Oengus excelled in all gallant deeds
so that he came to be styled Oengus of the poisonous javelin.&#160;
Cormac Mac Art Mac Conn it was who reigned in Ireland at this
time.&#160; Cormac had a son named Ceallach who took by force the
daughter of Eoghan Mac Fiacha Suighde to dwell with him,
<i>i.e.</i> Credhe the daughter of Eoghan.&#160; When Oengus
Gaebuaibhtheach ("of the poisonous javelin") heard this, viz., that
the daughter of his brother had been abducted by Ceallach he was
roused to fury and he followed Ceallach to Tara taking with him his
foster child, scil.:&#8212;Corc Duibhne, the son of Cairbre, son of
Conaire, son of Mogha Lamha whom Cormac held as a hostage from the
Munstermen, and whom he had given for safe custody to Oengus.&#160;
When Oengus reached Tara he beheld Ceallach sitting behind
Cormac.&#160; He thrust his spear at Ceallach and pierced him through
from front to back.&#160; However as he was withdrawing the spear the
handle struck Cormac's eye and knocked it out and then, striking
the steward, killed him.&#160; He himself (Oengus) with his foster
child escaped safely.&#160; After a time Cormac, grieving for the loss
of his son, his eye and his steward at the hands of Oengus of the
poisonous javelin and of his kinsmen, ordered their expulsion from
their tribal territory, <i>i.e.</i> from the Decies of Tara, and
not alone from these, but from whole northern half of Ireland.&#160;
However, seven battles were fought in which tremendous loss was
inflicted on Cormac and his followers before Oengus and his people,
<i>i.e.</i> the three sons of Fiacha Suighde, namely, Ross and
Oengus and Eoghan, as we have already said, were eventually
defeated, and obliged to fly the country and to suffer exile.&#160;
Consequent on their banishment as above by the king of Ireland they
sought hospitality from the king of Munster, Oilill Olum, because
Sadhbh, daughter of Conn Ceadcathach was his wife.&#160; They got land
from him, scil.:&#160; the Decies of Munster, and it is to that race,
<i>i.e.</i> the race of Eoghan Mac Fiacha Suighde that the kings
and country of the Decies belong ever since.
<p>&#160; &#160; 2.&#160; Of this same race of Eoghan was the holy bishop
Declan of whom I shall speak later scil.:&#160; Declan son of Eirc,
son of Trein, son of Lughaidh, son of Miaich, son of Brian, son of
Eoghan, son of Art Corp, son of Moscorb, son of Mesgeadra, son of
Measfore, son of Cuana Cainbhreathaigh, son of Conaire
Cathbuadhaigh, son of Cairbre, son of Eoghan, son of Fiacha
Suighde, son of Felimidh Reachtmhar, son of Tuathal Teachtmhar.&#160;
The father of Declan was therefore Erc Mac Trein.&#160; He and his
wife Deithin went on a visit to the house of his kinsman Dobhran
about the time that Declan's birth was due.&#160; The child she bore
was Declan, whom she brought forth without sickness, pain or
difficulty but in being lifted up afterwards he struck his head
against a great stone.&#160; Let it be mentioned that Declan showed
proofs of sanctification and power of miracle-working in his
mother's womb, as the prophet writes:&#8212;<i>"De vulva
sanctificavi te et prophetam in gentibus dedi te"</i> [Jeremias
1:5] (Before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee
and made thee a prophet unto the nations).&#160; Thus it is that
Declan was sanctified in his mother's womb and was given by God as
a prophet to the pagans for the conversion of multitudes of them
from heathenism and the misery of unbelief to the worship of Christ
and to the Catholic faith, as we shall see later on.&#160; The very
soft apex of his head struck against a hard stone, as we have said,
and where the head came in contact with the stone it made therein a
hollow and cavity of its own form and shape, without injury of any
kind to him.&#160; Great wonder thereupon seized all who witnessed
this, for Ireland was at this time without the true faith and it
was rarely that any one (therein) had shown heavenly Christian
signs.&#160; "Declan's Rock" is the name of the stone with which the
Saint's head came into contact.&#160; The water or rain which falls
into the before-mentioned cavity (the place of Declan's head)
dispels sickness and infirmity, by the grace of God, as proof of
Declan's sanctity.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 3.&#160; On the night of Declan's birth a wondrous sign was
revealed to all, that is to the people who were in the
neighbourhood of the birthplace; this was a ball of fire which was
seen blazing on summit of the house in which the child lay, until
it reached up to heaven and down again, and it was surrounded by a
multitude of angels.&#160; It assumed the shape of a ladder such as
the Patriarch, Jacob saw [Genesis 28:12].&#160; The persons who saw
and heard these things wondered at them.&#160; They did not know (for
the true faith had not yet been preached to them or in this region)
that it was God who (thus) manifested His wondrous power (works) in
the infant, His chosen child.&#160; Upon the foregoing manifestation a
certain true Christian, scil.:&#8212;Colman, at that time a priest
and afterwards a holy bishop, came, rejoicing greatly and filled
with the spirit of prophecy, to the place where Declan was; he
preached the faith of Christ to the parents and made known to them
that the child was full of the grace of God.&#160; He moreover
revealed to them the height of glory and honour to which the infant
should attain before God and men, and it was revealed to him that
he (Declan) should spend his life in sanctity and devotion.&#160;
Through the grace of God, these, <i>i.e.</i> Erc and Deithin,
believed in God and Colman, and they delivered the child for
baptism to Colman who baptised him thereupon, giving him the name
of Declan.&#160; When, in the presence of all, he had administered
Baptism, Colman spoke this prophecy concerning the infant:&#160;
"Truly, beloved child and lord you will be in heaven and on earth
most high and holy, and your good deeds, fame, and sanctity will
fill all (the four quarters of) Ireland and you will convert your
own nation and the Decies from paganism to Christianity.&#160; On that
account I bind myself to you by the tie of brotherhood and I
commend myself to your sanctity."</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 4.&#160; Colman thereupon returned to his own abode; he
commanded that Declan should be brought up with due care, that he
should be well trained, and be set to study at the age of seven
years if there could be found in his neighbourhood a competent
Christian scholar to undertake his tuition.&#160; Even at the period
of his baptism grace and surpassing charity manifested themselves
in the countenance of Declan so that it was understood of all that
great should be the goodness and the spiritual charm of his mature
age.&#160; When Dobhran had heard and seen these things concerning his
kinsman Erc he requested the latter and Deithin to give him the
child to foster, and with this request Erc complied.&#160; The name of
the locality was "Dobhran's Place" at that time, but since then it
has been "Declan's Place."&#160; Dobhran presented the homestead to
Declan and removed his own dwelling thence to another place.&#160; In
after years, when Declan had become a bishop, he erected there a
celebrated cell in honour of God, and this is the situation of the
cell in question:&#8212;In the southern part of the Decies, on the
east side of Magh Sgiath and not far from the city of Mochuda
<i>i.e.</i> Lismore.&#160; For the space of seven years Declan was
fostered with great care by Dobhran (his father's brother) and was
much loved by him.&#160; God wrought many striking miracles through
Declan's instrumentality during those years.&#160; By aid of the Holy
Spirit dwelling in him he (Declan)&#8212;discreet Christian man
that he was&#8212;avoided every fault and every unlawful desire
during that time.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 5.&#160; On the completion of seven years Declan was taken
from his parents and friends and fosterers to be sent to study as
Colman had ordained.&#160; It was to Dioma they sent him, a certain
devout man perfect in the faith, who had come at that time by God's
design into Ireland having spent a long period abroad in acquiring
learning.&#160; He (Dioma) built in that place a small cell wherein he
might instruct Declan and dwell himself.&#160; There was given him
also, to instruct, together with Declan, another child, scil.,
Cairbre Mac Colmain, who became afterwards a holy learned
bishop.&#160; Both these were for a considerable period pursuing their
studies together.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 6.&#160; There were seven men dwelling in Magh Sgiath, who
frequently saw the fiery globe which it has been already told they
first beheld at the time of Declan's birth.&#160; It happened by the
Grace of God that they were the first persons to reveal and
describe that lightning.&#160; These seven came to the place where
Declan abode and took him for their director and master.&#160; They
made known publicly in the presence of all that, later on, he
should be a bishop and they spoke prophetically:&#8212;"The day, O
beloved child and servant of God, will come when we shall commit
ourselves and our lands to thee."&#160; And it fell out thus (as they
foretold), for, upon believing, they were baptised and became wise,
devout (and) attentive and erected seven churches in honour of God
around Magh Sgiath.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 7.&#160; Declan remained a long time with Dioma, the holy
man we have named, and acquired science and sanctity and diversity
of learning and doctrine, and he was prudent, mild, and capable so
that many who knew his nobility of blood came when they had heard
of the fullness of his sanctity and grace.&#160; Moreover they
submitted themselves to him and accepted his religious rule.&#160;
Declan judged it proper that he should visit Rome to study
discipline and ecclesiastical system, to secure for himself esteem
and approbation thence, and obtain authority to preach to the
(Irish) people and to bring back with him the rules of Rome as
these obtained in Rome itself.&#160; He set out with his followers and
he tarried not till he arrived in Rome where they remained some
time.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 8.&#160; At the same period there was a holy bishop,
<i>i.e.</i> Ailbe, who had been in Rome for a number of years
before this and was in the household of Pope Hilary by whom he had
been made a bishop.&#160; When Declan with his disciples arrived in
Rome Ailbe received him with great affection and gladness and he
bore testimony before the Roman people to his (Declan's) sanctity
of life and nobility of blood.&#160; He (Declan) therefore received
marks of honour and sincere affection from the people and clergy of
Rome when they came to understand how worthy he was, for he was
comely, of good appearance, humble in act, sweet in speech, prudent
in counsel, frank in conversation, virtuous in mien, generous in
gifts, holy in life and resplendent in miracles.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 9.&#160; When Declan had spent a considerable time in Rome
he was ordained a bishop by the Pope, who gave him church-books and
rules and orders and sent him to Ireland that he might preach
there.&#160; Having bidden farewell to the Pope and received the
latter's blessing Declan commenced his journey to Ireland.&#160; Many
Romans followed him to Ireland to perform their pilgrimage and to
spend their lives there under the yoke and rule of Bishop Declan,
and amongst those who accompanied him was Runan, son of the king of
Rome; he was dear to Declan.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 10.&#160; On the road through Italy Bishop Declan and
Patrick met.&#160; Patrick was not a bishop at that time, though he
was (made a bishop) subsequently by Pope Celestinus, who sent him
to preach to the Irish.&#160; Patrick was truly chief bishop of the
Irish island.&#160; They bade farewell to one another and they made a
league and bond of mutual fraternity and kissed in token of
peace.&#160; They departed thereupon each on his own journey,
scil.:&#8212;Declan to Ireland and Patrick to Rome.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 11.&#160; Declan was beginning mass one day in a church
which lay in his road, when there was sent him from heaven a little
black bell, (which came) in through the window of the church and
remained on the altar before Declan.&#160; Declan greatly rejoiced
thereat and gave thanks and glory to Christ on account of it, and
it filled him with much courage to combat the error and false
teaching of heathendom.&#160; He gave the bell for safe keeping and
carriage, to Runan aforesaid, <i>i.e.</i> son of the king of Rome,
and this is its name in Ireland&#8212;"The Duibhin Declain," and it
is from its colour it derives its name, for its colour is black
[<i>dub</i>].&#160; There were manifested, by grace of God and
Declan's merits, many miracles through its agency and it is still
preserved in Declan's church.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 12.&#160; When Declan and his holy companions arrived at
the Sea of Icht [English Channel] he failed, owing to lack of
money, to find a ship, for he did not have the amount demanded, and
every ship was refused him on that account.&#160; He therefore struck
his bell and prayed to God for help in this extremity.&#160; In a
short time after this they saw coming towards them on the crest of
the waves an empty, sailless ship and no man therein.&#160; Thereupon
Declan said:&#8212;"Let us enter the ship in the name of Christ,
and He who has sent it to us will direct it skilfully to what
harbour soever He wishes we should go."&#160; At the word of Declan
they entered in, and the ship floated tranquilly and safely until
it reached harbour in England.&#160; Upon its abandonment by Declan
and his disciples the ship turned back and went again to the place
from which it had come and the people who saw the miracles and
heard of them magnified the name of the Lord and Declan, and the
words of the prophet David were verified:&#8212;<i>"Mirabilis Deus
in Sanctis Suis"</i> [Psalm 67(68):36] (God is wonderful in His
Saints).</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 13.&#160; After this Declan came to Ireland.&#160; Declan was
wise like a serpent and gentle like a dove and industrious like the
bee, for as the bee gathers honey and avoids the poisonous herbs so
did Declan, for he gathered the sweet sap of grace and Holy
Scripture till he was filled therewith.&#160; There were in Ireland
before Patrick came thither four holy bishops with their followers
who evangelized and sowed the word of God there; these are the
four:&#8212;Ailbe, Bishop Ibar, Declan, and Ciaran.&#160; They drew
multitudes from error to the faith of Christ, although it was
Patrick who sowed the faith throughout Ireland and it is he who
turned chiefs and kings of Ireland to the way of baptism, faith and
sacrifice and everlasting judgment.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 14.&#160; These three, scil.:&#8212;Declan, Ailbe and
Bishop Ibar made a bond of friendship and a league amongst
themselves and their spiritual posterity in heaven and on earth for
ever and they loved one another.&#160; SS. Ailbe and Declan,
especially, loved one another as if they were brothers so that, on
account of their mutual affection they did not like to be separated
from one another&#8212;except when their followers threatened to
separate them by force if they did not go apart for a very short
time.&#160; After this Declan returned to his own country&#8212;to the
Decies of Munster&#8212;where he preached, and baptized, in the
name of Christ, many whom he turned to the Catholic faith from the
power of the devil.&#160; He built numerous churches in which he
placed many of his own followers to serve and worship God and to
draw people to God from the wiles of Satan.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 15.&#160; Once on a time Declan came on a visit to the
place of his birth, where he remained forty days there and
established a religious house in which devout men have dwelt ever
since.&#160; Then came the seven men we have already mentioned as
having made their abode around Magh Sgiath and as having prophesied
concerning Declan.&#160; They now dedicated themselves and their
establishment to him as they had promised and these are their
names:&#8212;Mocellac and Riadan, Colman, Lactain, Finnlaoc, Kevin,
&amp;c. [Mobi].&#160; These therefore were under the rule and
spiritual sway of bishop Declan thenceforward, and they spent their
lives devoutly there and wrought many wonders afterwards.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 16.&#160; After some time Declan set out to visit Aongus
MacNatfrich, king of Cashel, to preach to him and to convert him to
the faith of Christ.&#160; Declan however had two uterine brothers,
sons of Aongus, scil.:&#160; Colman and Eoghan.&#160; The grace of the
Holy Ghost inspiring him Colman went to Ailbe of Emly and received
baptism and the religious habit at the latter's hands, and he
remained for a space sedulously studying science until he became a
saintly and perfect man.&#160; Eochaid however remained as he was (at
home)&#8212;expecting the kingdom of Munster on his father's death,
and he besought his father to show due honour to his brother
Declan.&#160; The king did so and put no obstacle in the way of
Declan's preaching but was pleased with Declan's religion and
doctrine, although he neither believed nor accepted baptism
himself.&#160; It is said that refusal (of baptism) was based on this
ground:&#160; Declan was of the Decies and of Conn's Half, while
Aongus himself was of the Eoghanacht of Cashel of
Munster&#8212;always hostile to the Desii.&#160; It was not therefore
through ill will to the faith that he believed not, as is proved
from this that, when the king heard of the coming to him of
Patrick, the archbishop of Ireland, a man who was of British race
against which the Irish cherished no hate, not only did he believe
but he went from his own city of Cashel to meet him, professed
Christianity and was immediately baptised.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 17.&#160; After this Declan, having sown the word of God
and preached to the king (although the latter did not assent to his
doctrines), proceeded to his own country and they (the Desii)
believed and received baptism except the king alone and the people
of his household who were every day promising to believe and be
baptised.&#160; It however came about through the Devil's agency that
they hesitated continually and procrastinated.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 18.&#160; Other authorities declare that Declan went many
times to Rome, but we have no written testimony from the ancient
biographers that he went there more than three times.&#160; On one of
these occasions Declan paid a visit to the holy bishop of the
Britons whose name was David at the church which is called
Killmuine [Menevia] where the bishop dwelt beside the shore of the
sea which divides Ireland from Britain.&#160; The bishop received
Declan with honour and he remained there forty days, in affection
and joy, and they sang Mass each day and they entered into a bond
of charity which continued between themselves and their successors
for ever afterwards.&#160; On the expiration of the forty days Declan
took leave of David giving him a kiss in token of peace and set out
himself and his followers to the shore of the sea to take ship for
Ireland.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 19.&#160; Now the bell which we have alluded to as sent
from heaven to Declan, was, at that time, in the custody of Runan
to carry as we have said, for Declan did not wish, on any account,
to part with it.&#160; On this particular day as they were proceeding
towards the ship Runan entrusted it to another member of the
company.&#160; On reaching the shore however the latter laid the bell
on a rock by the shore and forgot it till they were half way across
the sea.&#160; Then they remembered it and on remembrance they were
much distressed.&#160; Declan was very sorrowful that the gift sent
him by the Lord from heaven should have been forgotten in a place
where he never expected to find it again.&#160; Thereupon raising his
eyes heavenward he prayed to God within his heart and he said to
his followers:&#8212;"Lay aside your sorrow for it is possible with
God who sent that bell in the beginning to send it now again by
some marvellous ship."&#160; Very fully and wonderfully and
beautifully the creature without reason or understanding obeyed its
creator, for the very heavy unwieldy rock floated buoyantly and
without deviation, so that in a short time they beheld it in their
rear with the bell upon it.&#160; And when his people saw this
wondrous thing it filled them with love for God and reverence for
their master.&#160; Declan thereupon addressed them
prophetically:&#8212;"Permit the bell to precede you and follow it
exactly and whatsoever haven it will enter into it is there my city
and my bishopric will be whence I shall go to paradise and there my
resurrection will be."&#160; Meantime the bell preceded the ship, and
it eased down its great speed remaining slightly in advance of the
ship, so that it could be seen from and not overtaken by the
latter.&#160; The bell directed its course to Ireland until it reached
a harbour on the south coast, scil.:&#8212;in the Decies of
Munster, at an island called, at that time, High Sheep Island
[<i>Aird na gCcaorac</i>] and the ship made the same port, as
Declan declared.&#160; The holy man went ashore and gave thanks and
praise to God that he had reached the place of his resurrection.&#160;
Now, in that island depastured the sheep [<i>c&#225;oirigh</i>]
belonging to the wife of the chieftain of Decies and it is thence
that it derives its Irish name&#8212;Ard-na-Ccaorac,
scil.:&#8212;there was in it a high hill and it was a promontory
beautiful to behold.&#160; One of the party, ascending the summit of
the hill, said to Declan:&#8212;"How can this little height support
your people?"&#160; Declan replied:&#8212;"Do not call it little hill,
beloved son, but 'great height' [<i>ard m&#243;r</i>]," and that
name has adhered to the city ever since,
scil.:&#8212;Ardmore-Declain.&#160; After this Declan went to the king
of the Desii and asked of him the aforesaid island.&#160; Whereupon
the king gave it to him.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 20.&#160; Declan next returned to Ait-mBreasail where, in a
haven at the north side, were the shipping and boats of the island,
plying thither and backwards.&#160; The people of the island hid all
their boats not willing that Declan should settle there; they
dreaded greatly that if Declan came to dwell there they themselves
should be expelled.&#160; Whereupon his disciples addressed
Declan:&#8212;"Father," said they, "Many things are required
(scil.:&#160; from the mainland) and we must often go by boat to this
island and there will be (crossing) more frequently when you have
gone to heaven and we pray thee to abandon the place or else to
obtain from God that the sea recede from the land so that it can be
entered dry shod, for Christ has said:&#8212;'Whatsoever you shall
ask of the Father in my name He will give it to you' [John 15:16];
the place cannot be easily inhabited unless the sea recede from it
and on that account you cannot establish your city in it."&#160;
Declan answered them and said:&#8212;"How can I abandon the place
ordained by God and in which He has promised that my burial and
resurrection shall be?&#160; As to the alleged inconvenience of
dwelling therein, do you wish me to pray to God (for things)
contrary to His will&#8212;to deprive the sea of its natural
domain?&#160; Nevertheless in compliance with your request I shall
pray to God and whatever thing be God's will, let it be done."&#160;
Declan's community thereupon rose up and said:&#8212;"Father, take
your crosier as Moses took the rod [Exodus 14:16] and strike the
sea therewith and God will thus show His will to you."&#160; His
disciples prayed therefore to him because they were tried and holy
men.&#160; They put Declan's crosier in his hand and he struck the
water in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost and made the sign of the cross over the water and
immediately, by command and permission of God, the sea commenced to
move out from its accustomed place&#8212;so swiftly too that the
monsters of the sea were swimming and running and that it was with
difficulty they escaped with the sea.&#160; However, many fishes were
left behind on the dry strand owing to the suddenness of the
ebb.&#160; Declan, his crosier in his hand, pursued the receding tide
and his disciples followed after him.&#160; Moreover the sea and the
departing monsters made much din and commotion and when Declan
arrived at the place where is now the margin of the sea a stripling
whose name was Mainchin, frightened at the thunder of the waves and
the cry of the unknown monsters with gaping mouths following the
(receding) water, exclaimed:&#8212;"Father, you have driven out the
sea far enough; for I am afraid of those horrid monsters."&#160; When
Declan heard this and (saw) the sea standing still at the word of
the youth it displeased him and turning round he struck him a
slight blow on the nose.&#160; Three drops of blood flowed from the
wound on to the ground in three separate places at the feet of
Declan.&#160; Thereupon Declan blessed the nose and the blood ceased
immediately (to flow).&#160; Then Declan declared:&#8212;"It was not I
who drove out the sea but God in His own great power who expelled
it and He would have done still more had you not spoken the words
you have said."&#160; Three little wells of clear sweet water burst
forth in the place where fell the three drops of blood at the feet
of Declan, and these wells are there still and the colour of blood
is seen in them occasionally as a memorial of this miracle.&#160; The
shore, rescued from the sea, is a mile in width and is of great
length around (the island) and it is good and fertile land for
tillage and pasture&#8212;lying beneath the monastery of Declan.&#160;
As to the crosier which was in Declan's hand while he wrought this
miracle, this is its name&#8212;the Feartach Declain, from the
miracles and marvels [<i>fertaib</i>] wrought through it.&#160; I
shall in another, subsequent, place relate some of these miracles
(narrated).</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 21.&#160; After the expulsion of the sea by this famous
Saint, scil.:&#160; Declan, whose name and renown spread throughout
Erin because of his great and diverse miracles, he commenced to
build a great monastery by the south side of the stream which flows
through the island into the sea.&#160; This monastery is illustrious
and beautiful and its name is Ardmor Declain, as we have said.&#160;
After this came many persons to Declan, drawn from the uttermost
parts of Ireland, by the fame of his holy living; they devoted
themselves, soul and body to God and Declan, binding themselves
beneath his yoke and his rule.&#160; Moreover he built himself in
every place throughout the territory of the Decies, churches and
monasteries and not alone in his own territory (did he build) but
in other regions of Ireland under tribute to him.&#160; Great too were
the multitudes (thousands) of men and women who were under his
spiritual sway and rule, in the places we have referred to,
throughout Ireland, where happily they passed their lives.&#160; He
ordained some of his disciples bishops and appointed them in these
places to sow the seed of faith and religion therein.&#160; Gentleness
and charity manifested themselves in Declan to such an extent that
his disciples preferred to live under his immediate control and
under his direction as subjects than to be in authority in another
monastery.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 22.&#160; After this the holy renowned bishop, head of
justice and faith in the Gaelic island came into Ireland,
<i>i.e.</i> Patrick sent by Celestinus, the Pope.&#160; Aongus Mac
Nathfrich went to meet him soon as he heard the account of his
coming.&#160; He conducted him (Patrick) with reverence and great
honour to his own royal city&#8212;to Cashel.&#160; Then Patrick
baptised him and blessed himself and his people and his city.&#160;
Patrick heard that the prince of the Decies had not been baptised
and did not believe, that there was a disagreement between the
prince and Declan and that the former refused to receive
instruction from the latter.&#160; Patrick thereupon set out to preach
to the prince aforesaid.&#160; Next, as to the four bishops we have
named who had been in Rome:&#160; Except Declan alone they were not in
perfect agreement with Patrick.&#160; It is true that subsequently to
this they did enter into a league of peace and harmonious actions
with Patrick and paid him fealty.&#160; Ciaran, however, paid him all
respect and reverence and was of one mind with him present or
absent.&#160; Ailbe then, when he saw the kings and rulers of Ireland
paying homage to Patrick and going out to meet him, came himself to
Cashel, to wait on him and he also paid homage to him (Patrick) and
submitted to his jurisdiction, in presence of the king and all
others.&#160; Bear in mind it was Ailbe whom the other holy bishops
had elected their superior.&#160; He therefore came first to Patrick,
lest the others, on his account, should offer opposition to
Patrick, and also that by his example the others might be more
easily drawn to his jurisdiction and rule.&#160; Bishop Ibar however
would on no account consent to be subject to Patrick, for it was
displeasing to him that a foreigner should be patron of Ireland.&#160;
It happened that Patrick in his origin was of the Britons and he
was nurtured in Ireland having been sold to bondage in his
boyhood.&#160; There arose misunderstanding and dissension between
Patrick and Bishop Ibar at first, although (eventually), by
intervention of the angel of peace, they formed a mutual fellowship
and brotherly compact and they remained in agreement for ever
after.&#160; But Declan did not wish to disagree at all with Patrick
for they had formed a mutual bond of friendship on the Italian
highway and it is thus the angel commanded him to go to Patrick and
obey him:&#8212;</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 23.&#160; The angel of God came to Declan and said to him,
"Go quickly to Patrick and prevent him cursing your kindred and
country, for to-night, in the plain which is called Inneoin, he is
fasting against the king, and if he curses your people they shall
be accursed for ever."&#160; Thereupon Declan set out in haste by
direction of the angel to Inneoin, <i>i.e.</i> the place which is
in the centre of the plain of Femhin in the northern part of the
Decies.&#160; He crossed Slieve Gua [Knockmaeldown] and over the Suir
and arrived on the following morning at the place where Patrick
was.&#160; When Patrick and his disciples heard that Declan was there
they welcomed him warmly for they had been told he would not
come.&#160; Moreover Patrick and his people received him with great
honour.&#160; But Declan made obeisance to Patrick and besought him
earnestly that he should not execrate his people and that he should
not curse them nor the land in which they dwelt, and he promised to
allow Patrick do as he pleased.&#160; And Patrick replied:&#8212;"On
account of your prayer not only shall I not curse them but I shall
give them a blessing."&#160; Declan went thereupon to the place where
was the king of Decies who was a neighbour of his.&#160; But he
contemned Patrick and he would not believe him even at the request
of Declan.&#160; Moreover Declan promised rewards to him if he would
go to Patrick to receive baptism at his hands and assent to the
faith.&#160; But he would not assent on any account.&#160; When Declan
saw this, scil.:&#8212;that the king of the Decies, who was named
Ledban, was obstinate in his infidelity and in his
devilry&#8212;through fear lest Patrick should curse his race and
country&#8212;he (Declan) turned to the assembly and addressed
them:&#8212;"Separate yourselves from this accursed man lest you
become yourselves accursed on his account, for I have myself
baptised and blessed you, but come you," said he, "with us, to
Patrick, whom God has sent to bless you, for he has been chosen
Archbishop and chief Patron of all Erin; moreover, I have a right
to my own patrimony and to be king over you as that man (Ledban)
has been."&#160; At this speech they all arose and followed Declan who
brought them into the presence of Patrick and said to the
latter:&#8212;"See how the whole people of the Deisi have come with
me as their Lord to thee and they have left the accursed prince
whose subjects they have been, and behold they are ready to
reverence you and to obey you for it is from me they have received
baptism."&#160; At this Patrick rose up with his followers and he
blessed the people of the Deisi and not them alone, but their woods
and water and land.&#160; Whereupon the chiefs and nobles of the Deisi
said:&#8212;"Who will be King or Lord over us now?"&#160; And Declan
replied:&#8212;"I am your lord and whomsoever I shall appoint offer
you as lord, Patrick and all of us will bless, and he shall be king
over you all."&#160; And he whom Declan appointed was Feargal Mac
Cormac a certain young man of the nation of the Deisi who was a
kinsman of Declan himself.&#160; He (Declan) set him in the midst of
the assembly in the king's place and he was pleasing to all.&#160;
Whereupon Patrick and Declan blessed him and each of them apart
proclaimed him chieftain.&#160; Patrick moreover promised the young
man that he should be brave and strong in battle, that the land
should be fruitful during his reign.&#160; Thus have the kings of the
Deisi always been.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 24.&#160; After these things Declan and Feargal Mac Cormac
(king of the Deisi) and his people gave a large area of land to
Patrick in the neighbourhood of Magh Feimhin and this belongs to
his successors ever since and great lordship there.&#160; And the
place which was given over to him is not far from the Suir.&#160;
There is a great very clear fountain there which is called
"Patrick's Well" and this was dear to Patrick.&#160; After this, with
blessing, they took leave of one another and Patrick returned to
Cashel to Aongus Mac Natfrich and Declan went with him.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 25.&#160; A miracle was wrought at that time on Declan
through the intercession and prayers of Patrick for as Declan was
walking carelessly along he trod upon a piece of sharp iron which
cut his foot so that blood flowed freely and Declan began to
limp.&#160; Ailbe of Emly was present at this miracle and Sechnall a
bishop of Patrick's and a holy and wise man, and he is said to be
the first bishop buried in Ireland.&#160; The wound which Declan had
received grieved them very much.&#160; Patrick was informed of the
accident and was grieved thereat.&#160; He said:&#8212;"Heal, O Master
(<i>i.e.</i> God), the foot of your own servant who bears much toil
and hardship on your account."&#160; Patrick laid his hand on the
wounded foot and made over it the sign of the cross when
immediately the flow of blood ceased, the lips of the wound united,
a cicatrix formed upon it and a cure was effected.&#160; Then Declan
rose up with his foot healed and joined in praising God.&#160; The
soldiers and fighting men who were present cried out loudly,
blessing God and the saints.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 26.&#160; As Patrick and the saints were in Cashel,
<i>i.e.</i> Ailbe and Declan with their disciples, in the territory
of Aongus Mac Nathfrich, they made much progress against paganism
and errors in faith and they converted them (the pagans) to
Christianity.&#160; It was ordained by Patrick and Aongus Mac Natfrich
in presence of the assembly, that the Archbishopric of Munster
should belong to Ailbe, and to Declan, in like manner, was ordained
(committed) his own race, <i>i.e.</i> the Deisi, whom he had
converted to be his parish and his episcopate.&#160; As the Irish
should serve Patrick, so should the Deisi serve Declan as their
patron, and Patrick made the <i>rann:&#8212;</i></p>
<blockquote>"Humble Ailbe the Patrick of Munster, greater than any
saying,<br />
Declan, Patrick of the Deisi&#8212;the Decies to Declan for
ever."</blockquote>
This is equivalent to saying that Ailbe was a second Patrick and
that Declan was a second Patrick of the Decies.&#160; After that, when
the king had bidden them farewell and they had all taken leave of
one another, the saints returned to their respective territories to
sow therein the seed of faith.
<p>&#160; &#160; 27.&#160; Declan and Ferghal Mac Cormac, king of the Deisi,
with his army and followers, met one another at Indeoin and they
made still more strong on the people the bond of Christian
obligation.&#160; The king we have already mentioned,
scil.:&#8212;Ledban, the recusant to the Christian name, was
rejected of all and he came to nothing, leaving no knowledge
(memory) of his history, as is written of the enemies of the
faith:&#8212;"Their memory perisheth like a sound" [Psalm 9:7].&#160;
Moreover Declan and Fergal and the chief men of the Deisi decreed
this as the place where the king of the Deisi should be inaugurated
for ever thenceforward, because it was there Patrick and Declan
blessed the king, Fergal; moreover tradition states that it was
there the kings were crowned and ruled over the Deisi in pagan
times.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 28.&#160; At that time there broke out a dreadful plague in
Munster and it was more deadly in Cashel than elsewhere.&#160; Thus it
affected those whom it attacked:&#160; it first changed their colour
to yellow and then killed them.&#160; Now Aongus had, in a stone fort
called "Rath na nIrlann," on the western side of Cashel, seven
noble hostages.&#160; It happened that in one and the same night they
all died of the plague.&#160; The king was much affected thereat and
he gave orders to have the fact concealed lest it should bring
disgrace or even war upon him, for the hostages were scions of the
strongest and most powerful families in Munster.&#160; On the morrow
however Declan came to Cashel and talked with Aonghus.&#160; The king
welcomed him heartily and addressing him said to him in presence of
persons of his court, "I pray you, Declan, servant of God, that in
the name of Christ you would raise to life for me the seven
hostages whom I held in bondage from the chieftains of Munster.&#160;
They have died from the plague of which you hear, and I fear their
fathers will raise war and rebellion against me, for they are men
of strength and power, and indeed we are ashamed of their death,
for they will say that it is we ourselves who killed them."&#160;
Declan answered the king, saying to him:&#8212;"Such a matter as
this&#8212;to raise one to life from death&#8212;belongs to
Omnipotence alone&#8212;but I shall do whatever is in my power.&#160;
I go where the bodies lie and pray to God for them and let Him do
in their regard what seems best to Him."&#160; Next, Declan, with a
multitude and his disciples together with the king's councillors,
went to the place where the corpses of the young men lay.&#160; The
king followed after them until he came in sight of the bodies.&#160;
Declan, full of divine faith, entered the house wherein they lay
and he sprinkled holy water over them and prayed for them in the
presence of all, saying:&#8212;"O Lord Jesus Christ, only Son of
the living God, for thine own name's sake wake the dead that they
may be strengthened in the Catholic faith through our
instrumentality."&#160; Thereupon, at Declan's prayer, the group (of
corpses) revived and they moved their eyelids and Declan said to
them "In the name of Christ, our Saviour, stand up and bless and
glorify God."&#160; And at his words they rose up immediately and
spoke to all.&#160; Declan then announced to the king that they were
alive and well.&#160; When people saw this remarkable miracle they all
gave glory and praise to God.&#160; The fame of Declan thereupon
spread throughout Erin and the king rejoiced for restoration of his
hostages.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 29.&#160; After this the people of Cashel besought Bishop
Declan to bless their city and banish the plague from them and to
intercede with God for those stricken with sickness who could not
escape from its toils.&#160; Declan seeing the people's faith prayed
to God and signed with the sign of Redemption the four points of
the compass.&#160; As he concluded, there was verified the saying of
Christ to His disciples when leaving them and going to
heaven:&#8212;<i>"Super aegros imponent manus et bene habebunt"</i>
[Mark 16:18] (I shall place my hands on the sick and they shall be
healed).&#160; Soon as Declan had made the sign of the cross each one
who was ill became well and not alone were <i>these</i> restored to
health but (all the sick) of the whole region round about in
whatsoever place there were persons ailing.&#160; Moreover the plague
was banished from every place and all rejoiced greatly thereat as
well as on account of the resurrection of the dead men we have
narrated.&#160; The king thereupon ordered tribute and honour to
Declan and his successors from himself and from every king who
should hold Cashel ever after.&#160; Upon this the glorious bishop
Declan blessed Aongus together with his city and people and
returned back to his own place.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 30.&#160; One night Declan was a guest at the house of a
wealthy man who dwelt in the southern part of Magh Femhin; this is
the kind of person his host was, scil.:&#8212;a pagan who rejected
the true faith, and his name was Dercan.&#160; He resolved to amuse
himself at the Christians' expense; accordingly he ordered his
servants to kill a dog secretly, to cut off its head and feet and
to bury them in the earth and then to cook the flesh properly and
to set it before Declan and his company as their meal.&#160; Moreover
he directed that the dog should be so fat that his flesh might pass
as mutton.&#160; When, in due course, it was cooked, the flesh,
together with bread and other food, was laid before Declan and his
following.&#160; At that moment Declan had fallen asleep but he was
aroused by his disciples that he might bless their meal.&#160; He
observed to them:&#8212;"Indeed I see, connected with this meat,
the ministry of the devil."&#160; Whereupon he questioned the waiters
as to the meat&#8212;what kind it was and whence procured.&#160; They
replied:&#160; "Our master ordered us to kill a fat ram for you and we
have done as he commanded."&#160; Declan said, "Our Master is Jesus
Christ and may He show us what it is that connects the ministry of
Satan with this meat and preserve thy servants from eating
forbidden food."&#160; As he spoke thus Declan saw in the meat the
claw of a dog, for, without intending it, they had boiled one
quarter of the dog with its paw adhering; they thought they had
buried it (the incriminating limb) with the other paws.&#160; Declan
exclaimed, "This is not a sheep's but a dog's foot."&#160; When the
attendants heard this they went at once to their master and related
the matter to him.&#160; Then Dercan came to Declan, accepted his
faith and received Baptism at his hands, giving himself and his
posterity to Declan for ever.&#160; Moreover he gave his homestead to
Declan and his people were baptised.&#160; After this Dercan requested
that Declan should bless something in his homestead which might
remain as a memorial of him (Dercan) for ever.&#160; Then Declan
blessed a bell which he perceived there and its name is
Clog-Dhercain ("Dercan's Bell"); moreover, he declared:&#160; "I endow
it with this virtue (power) that if the king of Decies march around
it when going to battle, against his enemies, or to punish
violation of his rights, he shall return safely and with
victory."&#160; This promise has been frequently fulfilled, but proud
(men) undertaking battle or conflict unjustly even if they march
around it do not obtain victory but success remains with the
enemy.&#160; The name of that homestead was Teach-Dhercain ("Dercain's
House") and its name now is Coningean, from the claw [<i>con</i>]
of the hound or dog aforesaid.&#160; To this place came the saintly
concourse, scil:&#8212;Coman and Ultan, MacErc and Mocoba and
Maclaisren, who dedicated themselves to (the service of) God and
placed themselves under the spiritual rule and sway of Declan.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 31.&#160; Thereupon Declan established a monastery in that
place, scil.&#8212;in Coningin&#8212;and he placed there this holy
community with a further band of disciples.&#160; Ultan however he
took away with him to the place whither he went.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 32.&#160; On another (subsequent) occasion Declan visited
Bregia, <i>i.e.</i> the original territory which belonged to his
race previous to the expulsion of his ancestors.&#160; There he was
treated with particular honour by the king of Tara and by the
chieftains of Meath by whom he was beloved, since it was from
themselves (their tribe and territory) that his forbears had gone
out, for that region was the patrimony of his race and within it
lies Tara.&#160; Declan instituted therein a monastery of Canons, on
land which he received from the king, and it is from him the place
is named.&#160; Moreover he left therein a relic or illuminated book
and a famous gospel which he was accustomed to carry always with
him.&#160; The gospel is still preserved with much honour in the place
and miracles are wrought through it.&#160; After this again he turned
towards Munster.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 33.&#160; Declan was once travelling through Ossory when he
wished to remain for the night in a certain village.&#160; But the
villagers not only did not receive him but actually drove him forth
by force of arms.&#160; The saint however prayed to God that it might
happen to them what the Sacred Scripture says, "Vengeance is mine I
will repay" [Deuteronomy 32:35].&#160; The dwellers in the village,
who numbered sixty, died that same night with the exception of two
men and ten women to whom the conduct of the others towards the
saint had been displeasing.&#160; On the morrow these men and women
came humbly to the place where Declan was and they told
him&#8212;what he himself foreknew&#8212;how miserably the others
had died.&#160; They themselves did penance and they bestowed on
Declan a suitable site whereon he built a monastery and he got
another piece of land and had the dead buried where he built the
monastery.&#160; The name of that monastery is Cill-Colm-Dearg.&#160;
This Colm-Dearg was a kind, holy man and a disciple of Declan.&#160;
He was of East Leinster, <i>i.e.</i> of the Dal Meiscorb, and it is
from him that the monastery is named.&#160; When he (Declan) had
completed that place he came to his own territory again,
<i>i.e.</i> to the Decies.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 34.&#160; On a certain day Declan came to a place called
Ait-Breasail and the dwellers therein would not allow him to enter
their village; moreover they hid all their boats so that he could
not go into his own island, for they hated him very much.&#160; In
consideration however of the sanctity of his servant, who prayed in
patience, God the All-Powerful turned the sea into dry land as you
have already heard.&#160; Declan passed the night in an empty stable
out in the plain and the people of the village did not give him
even a fire.&#160; Whereupon, appropriately the anger of God fell on
them, who had not compassion enough to supply the disciple of God
with a fire.&#160; There came fire from heaven on them to consume them
all [together with their] homestead and village, so that the place
has been ever since a wilderness accursed, as the prophet
writes:&#160; <i>"civitates eorum destruxisti"</i> [Psalm 9:7] (the
dwellings of the unmerciful are laid waste).</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 35.&#160; On yet another occasion Declan was in his own
region&#8212;travelling over Slieve Gua in the Decies, when his
horse from some cause got lame so that he could proceed no
further.&#160; Declan however, seeing a herd of deer roaming the
mountain close to him, said to one of his people:&#160; "Go, and bring
me for my chariot one of these deer to replace my horse and take
with you this halter for him."&#160; Without any misgiving the
disciple went on till he reached the deer which waited quietly for
him.&#160; He chose the animal which was largest and therefore
strongest, and, bringing him back, yoked him to the chariot.&#160; The
deer thereupon obediently and without effort carried Bishop Declan
till he came to Magh Femhin, where, when he reached a house of
entertainment, the saint unloosed the stag and bade him to go free
as was his nature.&#160; Accordingly, at the command of the saintly
man and in the presence of all, the stag returned on the same road
back (to the mountain).&#160; Dormanach is the name of the man
aforesaid who brought the stag to Declan and him Declan blessed and
gave him a piece of land on the north of Decies close by the
Eoghanacht and his posterity live till now in that place.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 36.&#160; On another occasion, Declan, accompanied, as
usual, by a large following, was travelling, when one member of the
party fell on the road and broke his shin bone in twain.&#160; Declan
saw the accident and, pitying the injured man, he directed an
individual of the company to bandage the broken limb so that the
sufferer might not die through excess of pain and loss of blood.&#160;
All replied that they could not endure to dress the wound owing to
their horror thereof.&#160; But there was one of the company, Daluadh
by name, who faced the wound boldly and confidently and said:&#160;
"In the name of Christ and of Declan our patron I shall be surgeon
to this foot"; and he said that jestingly.&#160; Nevertheless he
bandaged the foot carefully and blessed it aright in the name of
God and Declan, and in a little while the wound healed and they all
gave praise to God.&#160; Then Declan said to Daluadh:&#160; "You
promised to be surgeon to that foot in Christ's name and in mine
and God has vouchsafed to heal it at these words:&#160; on this
account you will be a true physician for ever and your children and
your seed after you for ever shall also possess the healing art,
and whomsoever they shall practise healing upon in God's name and
mine, provided there be no hatred [in their hearts] nor too great
covetousness of a physician's fee to him, God and myself shall send
relief."&#160; This promise of Declan has been fulfilled in the case
of that family.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 37.&#160; On another occasion, as Declan was travelling in
the northern part of Magh Femhin beside the Suir, he met there a
man who was carrying a little infant to get it baptised.&#160; Declan
said to the people [his <i>muinntear,</i> or following]:&#160; "Wait
here till I baptise yonder child," for it was revealed by the Holy
Ghost to him that he [the babe] should serve God.&#160; The attendant
replied to him that they had neither a vessel nor salt for the
baptism.&#160; Declan said:&#160; "We have a wide vessel, the Suir, and
God will send us salt, for this child is destined to become holy
and wonderful [in his works]."&#160; Thereupon Declan took up a
fistful of earth and, making prayer in his heart to God, he signed
the clay with the sign of the cross of redemption.&#160; It (the
handful of earth) became white, dry salt, and all, on seeing it,
gave thanks and honour to God and Declan.&#160; The infant was
baptised there and the name of Ciaran given him.&#160; Declan said:&#160;
"Bring up my spiritual son carefully and send him, at a fitting
age, for education to a holy man who is well instructed in the
faith for he will become a shining bright pillar in the Church."&#160;
And it was this child, Ciaran Mac Eochaidh, who founded in after
years a famous monastery (from which he migrated to heaven) and
another place (monastery) besides.&#160; He worked many miracles and
holy signs and this is the name of his monastery Tiprut [Tubrid]
and this is where it is:&#8212;in the western part of the Decies in
Ui Faithe between Slieve Grot [Galtee] and Sieve Cua and it is
within the bishopric of Declan.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 38.&#160; On another day there came a woman to Declan's
monastery not far from the city where she dwelt.&#160; She committed a
theft that day in Declan's monastery as she had often done
previously, and this is the thing she stole&#8212;a <i>habellum</i>
[possibly an item of tribute]; she departed homewards taking it
with her and there met her a group of people on the highway, and
the earth, in their presence, swallowed her up, and she cast out
the tabellum from her bosom and it was quickly turned into a stone
which the wayfarers took and brought with them to Declan.&#160; Declan
himself had in supernatural vision seen all that happened to the
woman in punishment of her theft, and the name of Declan was
magnified owing to those marvels so that fear took possession of
all-those present and those absent.&#160; The stone in question
remains still in Declan's graveyard in his own town of
Ardmore-Declain, where it stands on an elevated place in memory of
this miracle.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 39.&#160; A rich man named Fintan was childless, for his
wife was barren for many years.&#160; He himself, with his wife,
visited Declan and promised large alms and performance of good
works provided he (Declan) would pray that they might have
children:&#160; they held it as certain that if Declan but prayed for
them God would grant them children.&#160; Declan therefore, praying to
God and blessing the pair, said:&#160; "Proceed to your home and
through God's bounty you shall have offspring."&#160; The couple
returned home, with great joy for the blessing and for the promise
of the offspring.&#160; The following night, Fintan lay with his wife
and she conceived and brought forth twin sons, scil.:&#160; Fiacha and
Aodh, who, together with their children and descendants were under
tribute and service to God and Declan.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 40.&#160; When it was made known to a certain holy man,
scil.:&#8212;Ailbe of Emly Iubar, chief bishop of Munster, that his
last days had come, he said to his disciples:&#160; "Beloved brethren,
I wish, before I die, to visit my very dear fellow worker,
scil.:&#8212;Declan."&#160; After this Ailbe set out on the journey
and an angel of God came to Declan notifying him that Ailbe was on
his way to visit him.&#160; On the angel's notification Declan ordered
his disciples to prepare the house for Ailbe's coming.&#160; He
himself went to meet Ailbe as far as the place which is called
Druim Luctraidh [Luchluachra].&#160; Thence they came home together
and Ailbe, treated with great honour by Declan and his people,
stayed fourteen pleasant days.&#160; After that the aged saint
returned home again to his own city, scil.:&#8212;to Emly Iubar.&#160;
Declan came and many of his people, escorting Ailbe, to Druim
Luchtradh, and Ailbe bade him return to his own city.&#160; The two
knew they should not see one another in this world ever again.&#160;
In taking leave of one another, therefore, they shed plentiful
tears of sorrow and they instituted an everlasting compact and
league between their successors in that place.&#160; Ailbe moreover
blessed the city of Declan, his clergy and people and Declan did
the same for Ailbe and they kissed one another in token of love and
peace and each returned to his own city.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 41.&#160; On a certain day the Castle of Cinaedh, King of
the Deisi, took fire and it burned violently.&#160; It happened
however that Declan was proceeding towards the castle on some
business and he was grieved to see it burning; he flung towards it
the staff to which we have referred in connection with the drying
up of the sea, and it (the staff) flew hovering in the air with
heavenly wings till it reached the midst of the flame and the fire
was immediately extinguished of its own accord through the grace of
God and virtue of the staff and of Declan to whom it belonged.&#160;
The place from which Declan cast the staff was a long mile distant
from the castle and when the king, <i>i.e.</i> Cinaedh, and all the
others witnessed this miracle they were filled with amazement and
gave thanks to God and to Declan when they came to know that it was
he who wrought it.&#160; Now the place where the castle stands is not
far from the Suir, <i>i.e.</i> on the south side of it and the
place from which Declan cast the staff is beside a ford which is in
the Suir or a stream which flows beside the monastery called Mag
Laca [Molough] which the holy virgins, daughters of the king of
Decies, have built in honour of God.&#160; There is a pile of stones
and a cross in the place to commemorate this miracle.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 42.&#160; On another occasion there approached a foreign
fleet towards Declan's city and this was their design&#8212;to
destroy and to plunder it of persons and of cattle, because they
(the foreigners) were people hostile to the faith.&#160; Many members
of the community ran with great haste to tell Declan of the fleet
which threatened the town and to request him to beg the assistance
of God against the invaders.&#160; Declan knew the man amongst his own
disciples who was holiest and most abounding in grace, scil.,
Ultan, already mentioned, and him he ordered to pray to God against
the fleet.&#160; Ultan had pity on the Christian people and he went
instantly, at the command of Declan, in front of the fleet and he
held his left hand against it, and, on the spot, the sea swallowed
them like sacks full of lead, and the drowned sailors were changed
into large rocks which stand not far from the mouth of the haven
where they are visible (standing) high out of the sea from that
time till now.&#160; All Christians who witnessed this rejoiced and
were glad and they gave great praise and glory to God and to Declan
their own patron who caused the working of this miracle and of many
other miracles besides.&#160; Next there arose a contention between
Ultan and Declan concerning this miracle, for Ultan attributed it
to Declan and Declan credited it to Ultan; and it has become a
proverb since in Ireland when people hear of danger or
jeopardy:&#8212;"The left hand of Ultan against you (the
danger)."&#160; Ultan became, after the death of Declan, a
miracle-working abbot of many other holy monks.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 43.&#160; The holy and glorious archbishop, <i>i.e.</i>
Patrick, sent one of his own followers to Declan with power and
authority (delegation) from the archbishop.&#160; And proceeding
through the southern part of Decies he was drowned in a river [the
Lickey] there, two miles from the city of Declan.&#160; When Declan
heard this he was grieved and he said:&#160; "Indeed it grieves me
that a servant of God and of Patrick who sent him to visit me,
having travelled all over Ireland, should be drowned in a river of
my own territory.&#160; Get my chariot for me that I may go in haste
to see his corpse, so that Patrick may come to hear of the worry
and the grief I have undergone because of his disciple's death."&#160;
The body had been recovered before the arrival of Declan by others
who were close at hand and it had been placed on a bier to be
carried to Ciaran for interment.&#160; Declan however met them on the
way, when he ordered the body to be laid down on the ground.&#160;
They supposed he was about to recite the Office for the Dead.&#160; He
(Declan) advanced to the place where the bier was and lifted the
sheet covering the face.&#160; It (the face) looked dark and deformed
as is usual in the case of the drowned.&#160; He prayed to God and
shed tears, but no one heard aught of what he said.&#160; After this
he commanded:&#8212;"In the name of the Trinity, in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost whose religious yoke I
bear myself, arise to us for God has given your life to me."&#160; He
(the dead man) rose up immediately at the command and he greeted
Declan and all the others.&#160; Whereupon Declan and his disciples
received him with honour.&#160; At first he was not completely cured
but (was) like one convalescent until (complete) health returned to
him by degrees again.&#160; He however accompanied Declan and remained
some time with him and there was much rejoicing in Declan's city on
account of the miracle and his (Declan's) name and fame extended
over the country generally.&#160; This disciple of Patrick was named
Ballin; he returned with great joy and he told him (Patrick) that
Declan had raised him from the dead.&#160; To many others likewise he
related what had happened to him.&#160; Patrick, in presence of many
persons, hearing of the miracle gave glory and thanks to God and
the name of Declan was magnified.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 44.&#160; With this extraordinary miracle wrought by Declan
we wish to conclude our discourse.&#160; The number of miracles he
wrought, but which are not written here, you are to judge and
gather from what we have written.&#160; And we wish moreover that you
would understand that he healed the infirm, that he gave sight to
the eyes of the blind, cleansed lepers, and gave "their walk" to
cripples; that he obtained hearing for the deaf, and that he healed
many and various diseases in many different places throughout
Ireland&#8212;(things) which are not written here because of their
length and because they are so numerous to record, for fear it
should tire readers to hear so much said of one particular
person.&#160; On that account we shall pass them by.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 45.&#160; When Declan realised that his last days were at
hand and that the time remaining to him was very short he summoned
to him his own spiritual son, scil., MacLiag (residing) in the
monastery which is on the eastern side of the Decies close to the
Leinstermen in order that, at the hour of death, he might receive
the Body and Blood of Christ and the Sacraments of the Church from
his hands.&#160; Thereupon he foretold to his disciples the day of his
death and he commanded them to bring him to his own city, for it
was not there he dwelt at the time but in a small venerable cell
which he had ordered to be built for him between the hill called
Ardmore Declain and the ocean&#8212;in a narrow place at the brink
of the sea by which there flows down from the hill above a small
shining stream about which are trees and bushes all around, and it
is called Disert Declain.&#160; Thence to the city it is a short mile
and the reason why Declan used go there was to avoid turmoil and
noise so that he might be able to read and pray and fast there.&#160;
Indeed it was not easy for him to stay even there because of the
multitude of disciples and paupers and pilgrims and beggars who
followed him thither.&#160; Declan was however generous and very
sympathetic and on that account it is recorded by tradition that a
great following (of poor, &amp;c.), generally accompanied him and
that moreover the little cell was very dear to him for the reason
we have given, and many devout people have made it their practice
to dwell therein.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; 46.&#160; When Declan fell ill and became weak in body, but
still strong in hope and faith and love of God, he returned to his
own city&#8212;his people and disciples and clergy surrounding
him.&#160; He discoursed to them on the commands of God and he
enjoined on them to live holily after his death, to be submissive
to authority and to follow as closely as possible the way he had
marked out and to preserve his city in a state of piety and under
religious rule.&#160; And when they had all heard the discourse it
grieved them greatly to perceive, from what he had said, he
realised that in a short time he would go away to heaven from
them.&#160; But they were consoled by his gentle words and then there
came to him the holy man, to wit, MacLiag, at his own request,
already referred to.&#160; He [Declan] received the Body and Blood of
Christ and the Sacraments of the Church from his [MacLiag's]
hand&#8212;surrounded by holy men and his disciples, and he blessed
his people and his dependents and his poor, and he kissed them in
token of love and peace.&#160; Thus, having banished images and the
sacrifices to idols, having converted multitudes to the true faith,
having established monasteries and ecclesiastical orders in various
places, having spent his whole life profitably and holily, this
glorious bishop went with the angels to heaven on the ninth day of
the Kalends of August [July 24] and his body was blessed and
honoured with Masses and chanting by holy men and by the people of
the Decies and by his own monks and disciples collected from every
quarter at the time of his death.&#160; He was buried with honour in
his own city&#8212;in Declan's High-Place&#8212;in the tomb which
by direction of an angel he had himself indicated&#8212;which
moreover has wrought wonders and holy signs from that time to
now.&#160; He departed to the Unity of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Ghost in <i>Saecula Saeculorum; Amen.</i>&#160; FINIS.</p>

<h1>Life of St. Mochuda.</h1>
<h1><i>Beata Mocuda.</i></h1>
</center>
The renowned bishop, Carthach, commonly called Mochuda, was of the
territory of Ciarraighe Luachra [North Kerry] and of the race of
Fergus Mac Roigh.
<p>&#160; &#160; The illustrious bishop, who is generally known as
Mochuda, was of the Ciarraighe Luachra; to be exact&#8212;he was of
the line of Fergus Mac Roigh, who held the kingship of Ulster, till
the time that he gave the kingship to a woman for a year and did
not get it back when the year was over.&#160; His descendants are now
to be found throughout various provinces of Ireland.&#160; He fell
himself, through the treachery of Oilioll, king of Connaght, and
the latter's jealousy of his wife, Meadbh, daughter of Eochaid
Feidhleach.&#160; Finghen Mac Gnaoi of Ciarraighe Luachra was father
of Mochuda, and his mother was Mead, daughter of Finghin, of Corca
Duibhne, in the vicinity of the stream called Laune in the western
part of Ireland.&#160; The forthcoming birth of Mochuda was revealed
to St. Comhghall by an angel, announcing&#8212;"There will be
conceived a child in the western part of Erin, and Carthach will be
his baptismal name and he will be beloved of God and men&#8212;in
heaven and on earth.&#160; He will come to you seeking direction as to
a proposed pilgrimage to Rome&#8212;but you must not permit the
journey for the Lord has assigned him to you; but let him remain
with you a whole year."&#160; All this came to pass, as foretold.&#160;
In similar manner the future Mochuda was foretold to St. Brendan by
an angel who declared:&#160; "There will come to you a wonder-working
brother who will be the patron of you and your kindred for ever;
the region of Ciarraighe will be divided between you and him, and
Carthach will be his name; to multitudes his advent will be cause
for joy and he will gain multitudes for heaven.&#160; His first city
will be Raithen [Rahen or Rahan] in the region of Fircheall,
territory of Meath and central plain of Ireland; this will become a
place revered of men, and revered and famous will be his second
city and church, scil.:&#8212;Lismore, which shall possess lordship
and great pre-eminence."</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; One day when there was a large meeting of people at a
certain place in Kerry, the men and women who were present saw
descending a fiery globe, which rested on the head of Mochuda's
mother, at that time pregnant of the future saint.&#160; The ball of
fire did no one any injury but disappeared before it did injury to
anyone.&#160; All those who beheld this marvel wondered thereat and
speculated what it could portend.&#160; This is what it did
mean:&#8212;that the graces of the Holy Spirit had visited this
woman and her holy child unborn.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda's father was a rich and powerful chieftain
owning two strong lioses&#8212;one, on the south side of Slieve
Mish, and the other, in which Mochuda first saw the light, beside
the River Maing [Maine].&#160; Both places were blessed for sake of
the Saint, who was conceived in one of them and born in the other;
it is even said that no evil disposed or vicious person can live in
either.&#160; Carthage in due course was sent to be baptised, and, on
the way, the servant who bore the infant, meeting a saintly man
named Aodhgan, asked him to perform the ceremony.&#160; There was
however no water in the place, but a beautiful well, which burst
forth for the occasion and still remains, yielded a supply.&#160; With
the water of this well the infant was baptised and Carthach, as the
angel had foretold, was the name given him.&#160; Nevertheless
<i>Mochuda</i> is the name by which he was commonly known, because
he was so called, through affection and regard, by his master (St.
Carthach Senior).&#160; Many scarcely know that he has any other name
than Mochuda and it is lawful to write either Mochuda or
Carthach.&#160; Speaking prophetically Aodhgan said of
him:&#8212;"This child whom I have baptised will become famous and
he will be beloved by God and men."&#160; That prophecy has been
fulfilled, for Mochuda was graceful of figure and handsome of
features as David, he was master of his passions as Daniel, and
mild and gentle like Moses.&#160; His parents however despised him
because he valued not earthly vanities and in his regard were
verified the words of David:&#8212;<i>"Pater meus et mater mea
derliquerunt me, Dominus autem assumpsit me"</i> [Psalm 26(27):10]
(For my father and my mother have left me and the Lord hath taken
me up).&#160; Like David too&#8212;who kept the sheep of his
father&#8212;Mochuda, with other youths, herded his father's swine
in his boyhood.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On a certain day as Mochuda, with his companion
swineherds and their charges, was in the vicinity of the River
Maing, he heard that the king of Ciarraighe Luachra was at his
residence called Achadh-di; he waited on the king by whom he was
kindly and politely received.&#160; The king, whose name was Maoltuile
and who wished to see Mochuda frequently, invited the youth to come
every day to the royal lios and to bring with him his companions,
who would be made welcome for his sake.&#160; One evening as Mochuda
sate in the king's presence Maoltuile gazed so long and so intently
at the youth that the queen (Dand, daughter of Maolduin Mac Aodha
Beannan, king of Munster) reproved her husband asking why he stared
every evening at the boy.&#160; "O wife," answered the king, "if you
but saw what I see, you would never gaze at anything else, for I
behold a wondrous golden chain about his neck and a column of fire
reaching from his head to the heavens, and since I first beheld
these marvels my affection for the boy has largely increased."&#160;
"Then," said the queen, "let him sit there beside you."&#160;
Thenceforth the youth sate as suggested.&#160; Sometimes Mochuda
herded the swine in the woods and at other times he remained with
the king in his court.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; One day as Mochuda was keeping his herd as usual beside
the river already alluded to, he heard the bishop and his clerics
pass by, chanting psalms as they went along.&#160; The Spirit of God
touched the boy's heart and leaving his pigs Mochuda followed the
procession as far as the monastery called Tuaim [Druim Fertain]
[into which the clerics entered].&#160; And as the bishop and his
household sate down to eat, Mochuda, unknown to them, concealed
himself&#8212;sitting in the shadow of the doorway.&#160; Meanwhile
the king, Maoltuile, was troubled about the boy, noticing his
absence [from the homestead at Achaddi] that evening and not
knowing the cause thereof.&#160; He immediately sent messengers to
seek the youth throughout the country, and one of these found him
sitting, as indicated, in the shadow of the doorway of the bishop's
house.&#160; The messenger took Mochuda with him back to the king.&#160;
The latter questioned him:&#8212;"My child, why have you stayed
away in this manner?"&#160; Mochuda replied, "Sire, this is why I have
stayed away&#8212;through attraction of the holy chant of the
bishop and clergy; I have never heard anything so beautiful as
this; the clerics sang as they went along the whole way before me;
they sang until they arrived at their house, and thenceforth they
sang till they went to sleep.&#160; The bishop however remained by
himself far into the night praying by himself when the others had
retired.&#160; And I wish, O king, that I might learn [their psalms
and ritual].&#160; Hearing this the king at once sent a message to the
bishop requesting the latter to come to him.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; About this time Mochuda's father gave a feast in the
king's honour and as the company were at supper the king calling
Mochuda before him offered him a shield, sword, javelin, and
princely robe, saying:&#160; "Take these and be henceforth a knight to
me as your father has been."&#160; But Mochuda declined the offer.&#160;
"What is it," asked the king, "that you will accept, so that
[whatever it be] I may give it to you?"&#160; Mochuda
answered:&#8212;"I do not long for anything of earth&#8212;only
that I be allowed to learn the psalms of the clerics which I heard
them sing."&#160; In this answer the king discerned the working of
divine grace, whereupon he promised the youth the favour he asked
for.&#160; Shortly afterwards the bishop, Carthach, whom we have
mentioned as sent for by the king, arrived, and to him the latter
entrusted Mochuda to be instructed in reading and writing.&#160; With
great joy the bishop undertook his charge for he saw that his pupil
was marked by grace, and under the bishop's guidance and tutelage
Mochuda remained till his promotion to the priesthood.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda was very handsome of features with the result
that at different times during his youth maidens to the number of
thirty were so enamoured of him that they could not conceal their
feeling.&#160; But Mochuda prayed for them, and obtained for them by
his prayers that their carnal love should be turned into a
spiritual.&#160; They afterwards became consecrated religious and
within what to-day is his parish he built them cells and
monasteries which the holy virgins placed under his protection and
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Finntan Mac Cartan, bringing with him an infant for
baptism came to Bishop Carthach.&#160; The latter said to
him:&#8212;"Let the young priest there who was ordained to-day
baptise the child."&#160; Whereupon Finntan handed the infant to the
young priest.&#160; Mochuda enquired the name he was to impose, and
the father answered&#8212;Fodhran.&#160; Having administered baptism
Mochuda taking the infant's hand prophesied concerning the
babe&#8212;"This hand will be strong in battle and will win
hostages and submission of the Clan Torna whose country lies in
mid-Kerry from Sliabh Luachra [Slieve Lougher] to the sea.&#160; From
his seed, moreover, will spring kings to the end of time, unless
indeed they refuse me due allegiance, and if, at any time, they
incur displeasure of my successors their kingship and dominion will
come to an end."&#160; This prophecy has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Sometime afterwards Mochuda with his master, Carthach,
visited King Maoltuile, whom they found at a place called Feorainn,
near Tralee, from which the lords and kings of Kerry take their
name.&#160; Said Bishop Carthach:&#8212;"Here, Sire, is the youth you
gave me to train; he is a good scholar and he has studied the holy
writings with much success.&#160; I have ordained him a priest and
(his) grace is manifest in many ways."&#160; "What recompense do you
desire for your labour?" asked the king.&#160; "Only," replied
Carthach, "that you would place yourself and your posterity under
the spiritual jurisdiction of this young priest, the servant of
God."&#160; The king, however, hesitated&#8212;because of Mochuda's
youth.&#160; Soon as Carthach perceived this he himself inclined to
Mochuda and bending his knee before him exclaimed:&#8212;"I hereby
give myself, my parish and monastery to God and to Mochuda for
ever."&#160; Touched by the bishop's example the king prostrated
himself before Mochuda and pledged to God and to him, his soul and
body and posterity to the end of time.&#160; Then Mochuda placed his
foot upon the king's neck and measured the royal body with his
foot.&#160; Against this proceeding of Mochuda's a member of the
king's party protested in abusive and insulting terms&#8212;"It is
a haughty act of yours, laying your foot upon the king's neck, for
be it known to you the body on which you trample is worthy of
respect."&#160; On hearing this Mochuda ceased to measure the king and
declared:&#8212;"The neck upon which I have set my heel shall never
be decapitated and the body which I have measured with my foot
shall not be slain and but for your interference there would not be
wanting anything to him or his seed for ever."&#160; Addressing
(specially) the interrupter, he prophesied:&#8212;"You and your
posterity will be for ever contemptible among the tribes."&#160;
Blessing the king he promised him prosperity here and heaven
hereafter and assured him:&#8212;"If any one of your posterity
contemn my successors refusing me my lawful dues he will never
reign over the kingdom of Kerry."&#160; This prophecy has been
fulfilled.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Next, Mochuda, at the suggestion of his master, the
bishop, and the King Maoltuile, built a famous cell called
Kiltulach [Kiltallagh] at a place between Sliabh Mis and the River
Maing in the southern part of Kerry.&#160; Here his many miracles won
him the esteem of all.&#160; In that region he found two bishops
already settled before him, scil.:&#8212;Dibhilin and Domailgig.&#160;
These became envious of the honour paid him and the fame he
acquired, and they treated him evilly.&#160; Whereupon he went to
Maoltuile and told him the state of affairs.&#160; Soon as the king
heard the tale he came with Mochuda from the place where he then
was on the bank of the Luimnech and stayed not till they reached
the summit of Sliabh Mis, when he addressed Mochuda:&#160; "Leave this
confined region for the present to the envy and jealousy of the
bishops and hereafter it will become yours and your coarbs' to the
end of time."&#160; The advice commended itself to Mochuda and he
thanked the king for it.&#160; Thereupon he abandoned his cell to the
aforesaid bishops and determined to set out alone as a pilgrim to
the northern part of Ireland.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; In the meantime an angel visited Comghall and repeated
to him what had been foretold him already&#8212;that there should
come to him a young priest desirous for Christ's sake of pilgrimage
beyond the seas&#8212;that Comghall should dissuade him and,
instead, retain the stranger with him for a year at Bangor.&#160; "And
how am I to recognise him?" asked Comghall.&#160; The angel
answered:&#8212;"Whom you shall see going from the church to the
guest-house" (for it was Mochuda's custom to visit the church
first).&#160; [See note 1.]&#160; Comghall announced to his household
that there was coming to them a distinguished stranger,
well-beloved of God, of whose advent an angel had twice foretold
him.&#160; Some time later Mochuda arrived at Comghall's
establishment, and he went first to the monastery and Comghall
recognised him and bade him welcome.&#160; In that place Mochuda
remained a whole year, as the angel had said, and at the end of the
year he returned to his own country where he built many cells and
churches and worked many wonders, winning many souls to religion
and to good works.&#160; Many persons moreover placed themselves,
their children, and their kindred under his jurisdiction, and the
great parishes of their own territory were assigned to him, and
finally the episcopate of Kerry became his.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Subsequent to this Mochuda, having committed the care of
his cell and parish to certain pious and suitable persons, set out
himself, accompanied by a few disciples, through the south of
Munster to visit the Monastery of Ciaran Mac Fionntan at Rosgiallan
[Rostellan].&#160; From Ciaran Mochuda enquired, where&#8212;in south
Munster (as the angel had mentioned to Comghall)&#8212;the chief
and most distinguished of these churches should be.&#160; Ciaran, who
possessed the spirit of prophecy, replied&#8212;"You shall go first
to Meath where you will found a famous church in the territory of
Ibh Neill and there you will remain for forty years.&#160; You shall
be driven thence into exile and you will return to Munster wherein
will be your greatest and most renowned church."&#160; Mochuda offered
to place himself under the patronage and jurisdiction of Ciaran:&#160;
"Not so, shall it be," said Ciaran, "but rather do I put myself and
my church under you, for ever, reserving only that my son,
Fuadhran, be my successor in this place."&#160; This Mochuda assented
to and Fuadhran governed the monastic city for twenty years as
Ciaran's successor in the abbacy.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Next, Mochuda entered the territory of the Munster
Decies where dwelt the Clanna Ruadhain who placed themselves and
all their churches under him, and one Colman Mac Cobhthaigh a
wealthy magnate of the region donated extensive lands to Mochuda
who placed them under devout persons&#8212;to hold for him.&#160;
Proceeding thence Mochuda took his way across Sliabh Gua looking
back from the summit of which he saw by the bank of the Nemh
[Blackwater] angels ascending towards heaven and descending
thence.&#160; And they took up with them to heaven a silver chair with
a golden image thereon.&#160; This was the place in which long
afterwards he founded his famous church and whence he departed
himself to glory.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Hence Mochuda travelled to Molua Mac Coinche's monastery
of Clonfert [Kyle], on the confines of Leinster and Munster.&#160; He
found Molua in the harvest field in the midst of a <i>meitheal</i>
[team] of reapers.&#160; Before setting out on this present journey of
his Mochuda had, with one exception, dismissed all his disciples to
their various homes for he, but with a single companion, did not
wish to enter the strange land ostentatiously.&#160; The single
follower whom Mochuda had retained wishing to remain at Clonfert,
said to St. Molua:&#160; "Holy father, I should wish to remain here
with you."&#160; Molua answered:&#8212;"I shall permit you, brother,
if your pious master consents."&#160; Mochuda, having dismissed so
many, would not make any difficulty about an individual, and so he
gave the monk his freedom.&#160; Mochuda thereupon set out alone,
which, Molua's monks observing, they remark:&#8212;"It were time
for that aged man to remain in some monastery, for it is unbecoming
such a (senior) monk to wander about alone."&#160; They did not know
that he, of whom they spoke, was Mochuda, for it was not the custom
of the latter to make himself known to many.&#160; "Say not so," said
Molua (to the censorious brethren), "for the day will come when our
community and city will seem but insignificant beside
his&#8212;though now he goes alone; you do not know that he is
Mochuda whom many obey and whom many more will obey in times to
come."</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; As Mochuda went on his lonely way he met two monks who
asked him whither he was bound.&#160; "To Colman Elo," he answered.&#160;
Then said one of them to him:&#8212;"Take us with you as monks and
subjects," for they judged him from his countenance to be a holy
man.&#160; Mochuda accepted the monks and they journeyed on together
till they came to Colman's monastery [Lynally].&#160; Mochuda said to
Colman:&#160; "Father I would remain here with you."&#160; "Not so,"
replied Colman, "but go you to a place called Rahen in this
vicinity; that is the place ordained by God for your dwelling and
you shall have there a large community in the service of God and
from that place you will get your first name&#8212;Mochuda of
Rahen."&#160; Having said farewell to Colman and obtained his blessing
Mochuda, with his two monks, set out for the place indicated and
there in the beginning he built a small cell and Colman and he
often afterwards exchanged visits.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Colman had in the beginning&#8212;some time previous to
Mochuda's advent&#8212;contemplated establishing himself at Rahen
and he had left there two or three [bundles] of rods remarking to
his disciples that another should come after him for whom and not
for himself God had destined this place.&#160; It was with this
material that Mochuda commenced to build his cell as Colman had
foretold in the first instance.&#160; He erected later a great
monastery in which he lived forty years and had eight hundred and
eighty seven religious under his guidance and rule.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Subsequent to Mochuda's foundation of Rahen his miracles
and the marvels he wrought spread his fame far and wide through
Ireland and through Britain, and multitudes came to him from
various parts of those countries to give themselves to the service
of God under his guidance.&#160; In the beginning he refused worldly
gifts from others although his church was honoured and patronised
by neighbouring kings and chieftains who offered him lands and
cattle and money and many other things.&#160; Mochuda kept his monks
employed in hard labour and in ploughing the ground for he wanted
them to be always humble.&#160; Others, however, of the Saints of Erin
did not force their monks to servile labour in this fashion.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda was consecrated bishop by many saints and from
time to time he visited his parish in Kerry, but as a rule he
remained at Rahen with his monks, for it is monks he had with him
not clerics.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On a certain day in the (early) springtime there came to
tempt him a druid who said to him:&#8212;"In the name of your God
cause this apple-tree branch to produce foliage."&#160; Mochuda knew
that it was in contempt for divine power the druid proposed this,
and the branch put forth leaves on the instant.&#160; The druid
demanded "In the name of your God, put blossom on it."&#160; Mochuda
made the sign of the cross [over the twig] and it blossomed
presently.&#160; The druid persisted:&#8212;"What profits blossom
without fruit?" [said the druid].&#160; Mochuda, for the third time,
blessed the branch and it produced a quantity of fruit.&#160; The
druid said:&#8212;"Follower of Christ, cause the fruit to
ripen."&#160; Mochuda blessed the tree and the fruit, fully ripe, fell
to the earth.&#160; The druid picked up an apple off the ground and
examining it he saw it was quite sour, whereupon he
objected:&#8212;"Such miracles as these are worthless since it
leaves the fruit uneatable."&#160; Mochuda blessed the apples and they
all became sweet as honey, and in punishment of his opposition the
magician was deprived for a year of his eyesight.&#160; At the end of
a year he came to Mochuda and did penance, whereupon he received
his sight back again and he returned home rejoicing.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On another occasion there came to Mochuda a secular who
brought with him his deaf and dumb son whom he besought the saint
to heal.&#160; Mochuda prayed to God for him and said, "My son, hear
and speak."&#160; The boy answered immediately and said, "Man of God,
I give myself and my inheritance to you for ever," and thenceforth
he possessed the use of all his senses and members.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Another day a young man who had contracted leprosy came
to Mochuda showing him his misery and his wretched condition.&#160;
The saint prayed for him and he was restored to health.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; At another time there came to Mochuda a man whose face
was deformed.&#160; He besought the saint's aid and his face was
healed upon the spot.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On yet another occasion in the springtime a poor man who
dwelt some distance from the monastery of Rahen, came to Mochuda,
and asked the loan of two oxen and a ploughman to do a day's
ploughing for him.&#160; But Mochuda, as we have already said, had no
cattle, for it was the monks themselves who dug and tilled the
soil.&#160; Mochuda summoned one of his labourers named Aodhan whom he
ordered to go into the nearest wood to bring back thence a pair of
deer with him and go along with them to the poor man to do the
spring work for him.&#160; Aodhan did dutifully all that Mochuda bade
him&#8212;he found the two deer, went with the poor man and
ploughed for him till the work was completed when the deer returned
to their habitat and Aodhan to Mochuda.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On another day there came to Mochuda a man troubled by
the devil.&#160; Mochuda cured him at once, driving the demons from
him and the man went his way thanking God and Mochuda.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Once, when the brethren were at work in the fields and
in the kitchen, Mochuda went to the mill to grind meal for the
monk's use, and nine robbers, who hated him, followed with the
intention of murdering him.&#160; The chief of the band sent each
member of the gang to the mill in turn.&#160; Not one of them however
could enter the mill because of a violent flame of fire which
encircled the building round about, through the goodness of God
protecting Mochuda from the robbers.&#160; The latter, through the
mill door, watched Mochuda who slept portion of the time and was
awake another portion.&#160; And while he slept the mill stopped of
itself, and while he was awake it went of its own accord.&#160; The
gang thereupon returned to the chief and told him all they had
seen, which, when he heard, he became enraged.&#160; Then he hastened
himself to the mill to kill Mochuda.&#160; But he experienced the same
things as all the others and he was unable to hurt Mochuda.&#160; He
returned to his followers and said to them&#8212;"Let us stay here
till he comes out of the mill, for we need not fear that he will
call help nor need we fear his arm."&#160; Shortly afterwards Mochuda
came out carrying his load.&#160; The robbers rushed on him, but they
were unable to do him any injury for as each man of them tried to
draw his weapon his hands became powerless, so he was unable to use
them.&#160; Mochuda requested them to allow him pass with his burden
and he promised them on his credit and his word that he should
return to them when he had deposited the sack in safety.&#160; They
took his word and he went, deposited his bag of meal in the
kitchen, and returned meekly to martyrdom.&#160; The brethren imagined
he had gone to a quiet place for prayer as was his custom.&#160; When
he returned to the robbers they drew their weapons several times to
kill him but they were unable to do so.&#160; Seeing this wonder they
were moved to repentance and they gave themselves to God and to
Mochuda for ever and, till the time of their death, they remained
under his guidance and rule and many subsequent edifying and famous
acts of theirs are recorded.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; An angel came to Mochuda at Rahen on another occasion
announcing to him the command of God that he should go that same
day to Mac Fhiodaig, king of his own region of Kerry Luachra, and
administer to him Holy Communion and Confession as he was on the
point of death.&#160; Mochuda asked the angel how he could reach Kerry
that day from Rahen.&#160; The angel thereupon (for reply) took him up
through the air in a fiery chariot until they arrived at the king's
residence.&#160; Mochuda administered Holy Communion and Confession
and the king having bestowed generous alms upon him departed hence
to glory.&#160; Mochuda returned that same day to Rahen where he found
the community singing vespers.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On another occasion Mochuda visited Colman Elo at the
latter's monastery of Lynally and requested Colman to come with him
to consecrate for him his cemetery at Rahen, for Colman, assisted
by angels, was in the habit of consecrating cemeteries and God gave
him the privilege that no one should go to hell who was interred in
a grave consecrated by him.&#160; Colman said to him:&#8212;"Return
home and on the fifth day from now I shall follow."&#160; Mochuda
returned home, where he remained till the fifth day, when, seeing
that Colman had not arrived he came again to the latter.&#160;
"Father," said he, "why have you not kept your promise?"&#160; To
which Colman replied, "I came and an angel with me that day and
consecrated your cemetery.&#160; Return now and you will find it
marked (consecrated) on the south side of your own cell.&#160; Lay it
out as it is there indicated and think not that its area is too
small, because a larger will be consecrated for you later, by the
angels, in the southern part of Erin, namely&#8212;in Lismore."&#160;
Mochuda returned and found the cemetery duly marked as Colman had
indicated.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; About the same time clerics came across Slieve Luachra
in the territory of Kerry to the church of Ita, honoured [abbess]
of Conall Gabhra.&#160; They had with them a child upon seeing whom
Ita wept bitterly.&#160; The clerics demanded why she cried at seeing
them.&#160; "Blessed," she answered, "is the hour in which that youth
in your company was born, for no one shall ever go to hell from the
cemetery in which he will be buried, but, alas, for me, that I
cannot be buried therein."&#160; The clerics asked what cemetery it
was in which he should be buried.&#160; "In Mochuda's cemetery," said
she, "which though it be as yet unconsecrated will be honoured and
famous in times to come."&#160; This all came to pass, for the youth
afterwards became a monk under Mochuda and he is buried in the
monastic cemetery of Lismore as Ita had foretold.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; A child on another occasion fell off the bridge of Rahen
into the river and was drowned.&#160; The body was a day and a night
in the water before it was recovered.&#160; Then it was brought to
Mochuda who, moved with compassion for the father in his loss of an
only son, restored the boy to life.&#160; Moreover he himself fostered
the child for a considerable time afterwards and when the youth had
grown up, he sent him back to his own country of Delbhna.&#160;
Mochuda's foster son begat sons and daughters and he gave himself
and them, as well as his inheritance, to God and Mochuda, and his
descendants are to this day servile tenants of the monastery.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Once as Mochuda, with large offerings, was returning
from Kerry to Rahen he passed through the confines of Delbhna
[Lemanaghan?] by the lake called Muincine [Lough Gur?] where he and
his party were overtaken by night.&#160; They found here before them
by the roadside revolving wheels, which an artisan, who was
erecting a mill on the stream from the lake, had set up for a
joke.&#160; As the wheels revolved they made a terrific noise which
was heard by the whole neighbourhood.&#160; Many of the inhabitants of
the neighbouring villages aroused by the noise rushed out, with
appeals for help and loud cries, to investigate the matter.&#160;
Mochuda's people were frightened by the din and their pack and
riding horses stampeded and lost their loads and it was not without
difficulty that they were caught again.&#160; Mochuda knew what caused
the noise and he told the workmen who had played this mischievous
trick that they should be scattered throughout the different
provinces of Ireland, that they should be always worthless and
unprofitable, that the mill they were engaged on should never be
finished and that their progeny after them should be valueless race
of mischief-makers.&#160; The latter are called the Hi-Enna [U&#237;
&#201;nna &#193;ine Aulium] to-day.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; One day Mochuda came to a place called Cluain-Breanainn
where apples abounded.&#160; His followers asked some apples for him
but the orchard owner refused them.&#160; Said Mochuda:&#8212;"From
this day forward no fruit shall grow in you orchard for ever," and
that prophecy has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda had in his monastery twelve exceedingly perfect
disciples, scil.:&#8212;Caoinche Mac Mellain [Mochua Mac Mellain or
Cronan], who was the first monk to enter Rahen; Mucoinog
[Mochoemog]; the three sons of Nascainn&#8212;Goban, Srafan, and
Laisren; Mulua [Molua]; Lugair; Mochomog Eile; Aodhan [Aedhan];
Fachtna Coinceann [Fiachna or Fiochrae]; Fionnlog and Mochomog who
became a bishop later.&#160; The virtue of these monks surpassed
belief and Mochuda wished to mitigate their austerities before
their death.&#160; He therefore built separate cells for them that
they might have some comfort in their old age as a reward for their
virtue in youth; moreover he predicted blessings for them.&#160; He
made [a prophecy] for one of them, mentioned above,
scil.:&#8212;Mochua Mac Mellain, for whom he had built a
comfortable cell at a place called Cluain-Da-Chrann.&#160; He said to
him:&#160; "Your place of resurrection will not be here but in another
place which God has given you."&#160; That prediction has been
verified.&#160; To a second disciple, scil.:&#8212;Fiachna, Mochuda
said:&#8212;"Your resurrection will not be in this place though I
have made you a cell here; you will have three further abiding
places, nevertheless it will be with your own companion, Aodhan,
that your remains will rest and your resurrection will be in the
territory of Ui Torna, and it is from you that the place will get
its name."&#160; For this Aodhan alluded to Mochuda likewise built
another cell in the land of Ui Torna close by Slieve Luachra, and
speaking prophetically he said to him:&#160; "The remains of your
fellow-disciple, Fiachna, will be carried to you hither and from
him will this place be named."&#160; That statement has been verified,
for the church is now called Cill-Fiachna and it was first called
Cill-Aeghain.&#160; Concerning other persons, Mochuda prophesied
various other things, all of them have come to pass.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; A child born of secret adultery was abandoned close by
the monastery of Rahen and Mochuda fostered the child until he
became a bishop, though no one knew his name or his progenitors.&#160;
Mochuda said:&#8212;"This child's name is Dioma and his father is
Cormac of the race of Eochaidh Eachach."&#160; All thereupon magnified
the foreknowledge of Mochuda, which he had from no other than the
Holy Spirit.&#160; Having consecrated him bishop, Mochuda instructed
him:&#160; "Go in haste to your own native region of Hy-Eachach in the
southern confines of Munster for there will your resurrection
be.&#160; War and domestic strife shall arise among your race and
kinsfolk unless you arrive there soon to prevent it."&#160; Dioma set
out, accompanied by another bishop, Cuana by name, who was also a
disciple of Mochuda's.&#160; They travelled into Ibh Eachach and Dioma
preached the word of God to his brethren and tribesmen.&#160; He made
peace between them and they built a monastery for him and he placed
himself, his kindred, and parish under his chosen master, Mochuda,
and he ended his life (there) in peace.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On another occasion Mochuda travelled from Rahen to the
provinces of Munster and entered Ciarraighe Corca.&#160; It happened
that Cairbre Mac Criomhthain, who was king of Munster, was at that
time in Magh-Cuirce, the place to which Mochuda came.&#160; At the
same time there fell a fire ball which destroyed one of the king's
residences, killing his wife, many of his people and his son, Aodh
Mac Cairbre, who were buried in the falling ruin.&#160; There were
killed there moreover two good carriage horses of the king's.&#160;
Cairbre besought Mochuda that he would restore the queen and his
son to life, and when the saint saw the king's faith he prayed for
him to God and then addressing the dead he said,&#8212;"Arise."&#160;
They arose thereupon and he gave them safe to the king and they all
gave glory and thanks to God and Mochuda.&#160; The king moreover made
large offerings of land and servile tenants to Mochuda.&#160; But one
of the tenants, through pride and jealousy, refused to obey
Mochuda, notwithstanding the king's command.&#160; Mochuda said:&#160;
"Your posterity will die out and their inheritance, for sake of
which you (mis)behave towards me, shall become mine for ever;
whosoever takes from me that which another has given me shall be
deprived of heaven and earth."&#160; That man and his posterity soon
came to nought.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On another occasion Mochuda sent a golden belt to Fergus
Mac Criomhthan who suffered from uncleanness of skin arising from
kidney disease and upon application of the girdle, by the blessing
of Mochuda he recovered.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Another time again a king of Munster, Cathal Mac Aodha,
in the region of Cuirche, was a sufferer from a combination of
complaints&#8212;he was deaf, lame, and blind, and when Mochuda
came to see him the king and his friends prayed the saint to cure
him.&#160; Mochuda therefore prayed for him and made the sign of the
cross on his eyes and ears and immediately he was healed of all his
maladies&#8212;he heard and saw perfectly, and Cathal gave
extensive lands to God and Mochuda for ever, scil:&#8212;Oilean
Cathail and Ros-Beg and Ros-Mor and Inis-Pic [Spike Island].&#160;
Mochuda placed a religious community in Ros-Beg to build there a
church in honour of God.&#160; Mochuda himself commenced to build a
church on Inis-Pic and he remained there a whole year.&#160; [On his
departure] Mochuda left there&#8212;in the monastery of
Inis-Pic&#8212;to watch over it, in his stead, and to keep it in
perfect order&#8212;the three disciples whom we have already named
(scil:&#8212;the three sons of Nascon, <i>i.e.</i> Goban a bishop,
Srafan a priest, and holy Laisren) together with the saintly
bishop, Dardomaighen [Domangenum], (who had conferred orders on
them in presence of Mochuda) and forty monks.&#160; Thereupon Mochuda
returned to Rahen.&#160; That island we have mentioned,
scil.:&#8212;Inis-Pic, is a most holy place in which an exceedingly
devout community constantly dwell.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda next directed his steps eastward through Munster
and he crossed the river then called Nemh, and now named the
Abhainn More.&#160; As he crossed he saw a large apple floating in the
middle of the ford.&#160; This he took up and carried away with him in
his hand.&#160; Hence (that ford is named) Ath-Ubhla in Fermoy
[Ballyhooley].&#160; His attendant asked Mochuda for the apple, but
the latter refused to give it saying&#8212;"God will work a miracle
by that apple and through me to-day:&#160; we shall meet Cuana Mac
Cailcin's daughter whose right hand is powerless so that she cannot
move it from her side.&#160; But she shall be cured by the power of
God through this apple."&#160; This was accomplished.&#160; Mochuda
espied the child playing a game with the other girls in the
faithche [lawn] of the Lios.&#160; He approached and said to
her:&#8212;"Take this apple."&#160; She, as usual, put forth her left
hand for the fruit.&#160; "You shall not get it in that hand, but take
it in the other."&#160; The girl full of faith tried to put out the
right hand, and on the instant the hand became full of strength and
blood and motion so that she took the apple in it.&#160; All rejoiced
thereat and were amazed at the wonder wrought.&#160; That night Cuana
said to his daughter:&#160; "Choose yourself which you prefer of the
royal youths of Munster and whomsoever your choice be I shall
obtain in marriage for you."&#160; "The only spouse I shall have,"
said she, "is the man who cured my hand."&#160; "Do you hear what she
says O Mochuda?" said the king.&#160; "Entrust the child to me,"
answered Mochuda, "I shall present her as a bride to God who has
healed her hand."&#160; Whereupon Cuana gave his daughter Flandnait,
together with her dowry and lands on the bank of Nemh, to God and
to Mochuda for ever.&#160; Cuana was almost incredibly generous.&#160;
Mochuda took the maiden with him to Rahen where she passed her
years happily with the religious women there till Mochuda was
expelled by the kings of Tara as you may hear.&#160; He took Flandnait
with him (from Rahen) in his party to her own native region that
she might build herself a cell there.&#160; She did build a famous
cell at Cluain Dallain in Mochuda's own parish.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Previous to his expulsion (from Rahen) Mochuda visited
the place where (later) he built Lismore and he heard the voice of
persons reading at Rahen, wherefore he said to his followers:&#160; "I
know that this is the place where God will permit us to build our
monastery."&#160; This prophecy was subsequently verified.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On a certain occasion Columcille came to Rahen where
Mochuda was and asked him:&#8212;"Is this place in which you now
are dear to you?"&#160; "It is, indeed," answered Mochuda.&#160;
Columcille said:&#160; "Let not what I say to you trouble
you&#8212;this will not be the place of your resurrection, for the
king of Erin and his family will grow jealous of you owing to
machinations of some of the Irish clergy, and they shall eventually
drive you hence."&#160; Mochuda questioned Columcille who had a true
prophetic gift&#8212;"In what other place then will my resurrection
be?"&#160; Columcille told him&#8212;"The place where from the summit
of Slieve Gua you saw the host of angels building a chair of silver
with a statue of gold therein on the bank of the Nemh&#8212;there
will your resurrection be, and the chair of silver is your church
in the midst of them [, and you are truly the golden statue in its
midst]."&#160; Mochuda believing what he heard thanked and glorified
God.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; As Mochuda on another day was at Rahen there came to him
a priest and monk of his own community from the northern part of
Munster; he made a reverence as was the custom of the monks, in
Mochuda's presence and said to him, "Father, I have complied with
all your commands and the precepts of God from the day I left Rahen
till now&#8212;except this&#8212;that, without your permission, I
have taken my brother from the secular life."&#160; "Verily I say to
you," answered Mochuda, "if you were to go to the top of a high
hill and to shout as loudly as you could and were to bring to me
all who heard the cry I should not refuse the habit of religion to
one of them."&#160; Hearing these words all realised the character and
extent of Mochuda's charity and returned thanks to God for it.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On a certain day about vesper time, because of the
holiness of the hour, Mochuda said to his monks:&#8212;"We shall
not eat to-day till each one of you has made his confession," for
he knew that some one of them had ill will in his heart against
another.&#160; All the brethren thereupon confessed to him.&#160; One of
them in the course of his confession stated:&#160; "I love not your
miller and the cause of my lack of charity towards him is this,
that when I come to the mill he will not lift the loads off the
horses and he will neither help me to fill the meal sacks nor to
load them on the horse when filled.&#160; And not this alone but he
does everything that is disagreeable to me; moreover I cannot tell,
but God knows, why he so acts.&#160; Often I have thought of striking
him or even beating him to death."&#160; Mochuda replied, "Brother
dear, the prophet says&#8212;<i>'Declina a malo et fac bonum'</i>
[Psalm 36(37):27] (Avoid evil and do good).&#160; Following this
precept let you act kindly towards the miller and that charity of
yours will move him to charity towards you and ye shall yet be
steadfast friends."&#160; Things went on thus for three days&#8212;the
monk doing all he could to placate the miller.&#160; Nevertheless the
miller did not cease his persecution, nor the brother his hate of
the miller.&#160; On the third day Mochuda directed the brother to
confess to him again.&#160; The brother said:&#8212;"This is my
confession, Father, I do not yet love the miller."&#160; Mochuda
observed:&#8212;"He will change to-night, and to-morrow he will not
break fast till you meet him and you shall sit on the same seat, at
the same table, and you shall remain fast friends for the rest of
your lives."&#160; All this came to pass; for that monk was, through
the instruction of Mochuda, filled with the grace of the Divine
Spirit.&#160; And he glorified and praised Mochuda, for he recognised
him as a man favoured by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On another occasion two British monks of Mochuda's
monastery had a conversation in secret.&#160; Mochuda, they said, is
very old though there is no immediate appearance of approaching
death&#8212;and there is no doubt that his equal in virtue or good
works will never be found&#8212;therefore if he were out of the way
one of us might succeed him.&#160; Let us then kill him as there is no
likelihood of his natural death within a reasonable time.&#160; They
resolved therefore to drown him in the river towards close of the
following night and to conceal all traces so that the crime could
never be discovered.&#160; They found him subsequently in a lonely
place where he was accustomed to pray.&#160; They bound him tightly
and carried him between them on their shoulders to the water.&#160; On
their way to the river they met one of the monks who used to walk
around the cemetery every night.&#160; He said to them:&#160; "What is
that you carry?"&#160; They replied that it was portion of the
monastic washing which they were taking to the river.&#160; He
however, under the insistent suggestion of the Holy Spirit,
believed them not.&#160; He said:&#160; "Put down your load till we
examine it."&#160; They were constrained to obey and the burden proved
to be&#8212;Mochuda.&#160; The monk who detected [the proposed murder]
was the overseer of the homestead.&#160; He said mournfully, "My God,
it is a dreadful work you are about."&#160; Mochuda said
gently:&#8212;"Son, it were well for me had that been done to me
for I should now be numbered among the holy martyrs.&#160; And it were
bad for them (the two wicked monks) for it is with Judas the
betrayer of his Lord they should be tortured for ever, who had
desired my death for their own advancement.&#160; Neither these
wretched men themselves nor anyone of their nation shall be my
coarb for ever, but my successors shall be of his race through whom
God has rescued me.&#160; Moreover my city shall never be without men
of the British race who will be butts and laughing-stocks and serve
no useful purpose."&#160; The person who saved Mochuda was of the
Ciarraighe race and it is of that same people that the coarbs and
successors of Mochuda have commonly been ever since.&#160; [See note
2.]</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda refused for a long while, as we have already
said, to accept cattle or horses from anyone; it was the monks
themselves who dug and cultivated the land and they did all the
haulage of the monastery on their own backs.&#160; St. Fionan however
who was a kinsman of Mochuda and had just returned from Rome, came
at this time on a visit to the monastery.&#160; He reproached Mochuda
saying:&#160; "Mochuda, why do you impose the burden of brute beasts
upon rational beings?&#160; Is it not for use of the latter that all
other animals have been created?&#160; Of a truth I shall not taste
food in this house till you have remedied this grievance."&#160;
Thenceforth Mochuda&#8212;in honour of Fionan&#8212;permitted his
monks to accept horses and oxen from the people and he freed them
from the hardship alluded to.&#160; Sometime later the holy abbot,
Lachtaoin [St. Lachten], compassionating Mochuda and his monks
because of their lack of cattle paid a visit to Rahen bringing with
him a gift of thirty cows and a bull, also a couple of cattlemen
and two dairymaids.&#160; Coming near Rahen he left the cattle in a
secluded place, for he did not wish them to be seen.&#160; Thereupon
he went himself to the monastery and simulating illness requested a
drink of milk.&#160; The house steward went to Mochuda to tell him
that Lachtaoin was ill and required milk.&#160; Mochuda ordered the
steward to fill a pitcher with water and bring it to him&#8212;and
this order was executed.&#160; Mochuda blessed the water which
immediately was changed into sweet new milk apparently of that
day's milking.&#160; He sent the milk to Lachtaoin but the latter
identified it as milk miraculously produced; he in turn blessed it
with the result that it was changed back again into water.&#160; He
complained:&#8212;"It is not water but milk I have asked for."&#160;
The messenger related this fact publicly.&#160; Lachtaoin
declared:&#8212;"Mochuda is a good monk but his successors will not
be able to change water to milk," and to the messenger he
said&#8212;"Go to Mochuda and tell him that I shall not break bread
in this house until he accept the alms which I have brought to the
community."&#160; On Mochuda agreeing to accept them he handed over
the cattle and dairymen to the monks of Rahen and the stewards took
charge of them.&#160; Mochuda said thereupon, that he should not have
accepted the cattle but as a compliment to Lachtaoin.&#160; Lachtaoin
replied:&#8212;"From this day forward there will be plenty cattle
and worldly substance in your dwelling-place and there will be a
multitude of holy people in the other place whence you are to
depart to heaven (for you will be exiled from your present
home)."&#160; After they had mutually blessed and taken leave and
pledged friendship Lachtaoin departed.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Once, at harvest time, the farm steward came to Mochuda
complaining that, though the crop was dead ripe, a sufficient
number of harvesters could not be found.&#160; Mochuda answered:&#160;
"Go in peace, dear brother, and God will send you satisfactory
reapers."&#160; This promise was fulfilled, for a band of angels came
to the ripest and largest fields, reaped and bound a great deal
quickly, and gathered the crop into one place.&#160; The monks
marvelled, though they knew it was God's work and they praised and
thanked Him and Mochuda.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The spirit of obedience amongst Mochuda's monks was such
that if any senior member of the community ordered another to lie
in the fire he would be obeyed.&#160; As an instance of
this,&#8212;some of the brethren were on one occasion baking bread
in an oven when one the monks said to another younger than himself,
"The bread is burning:&#160; take it out instantly."&#160; There was an
iron shovel for drawing out the bread but the brother could not
find it on the instant.&#160; He heeded not the flames which shot out
of the oven's mouth but caught the hot bread and shifted it with
his hands and suffered no hurt whatever.&#160; On another day the
monks were engaged in labour beside the river which runs through
the monastery.&#160; One of the senior monks called upon a young monk
named Colman to do a certain piece of work.&#160; Immediately, as he
had not named any particular Colman, twelve monks of the name
rushed into the water.&#160; The readiness and exactness of the
obedience practised was displayed in this incident.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Great moreover was their meekness and patience in
sickness or ill-health as appears from the case of the monk out of
the wounds of whose body maggots fell as he walked; yet he never
complained or told anyone or left his work for two moments although
it was plain from his appearance that his health was declining, and
he was growing thinner from day to day.&#160; The brothers pitied him
very much.&#160; At length Mochuda questioned him&#8212;putting him
under obedience to tell the truth&#8212;as to the cause of his
decline.&#160; The monk thereupon showed him his sides which were torn
by a twig tied fast around them.&#160; Mochuda asked him who had done
that barbarous and intolerable thing to him.&#160; The monk
answered:&#8212;"One day while we were drawing logs of timber from
the wood my girdle broke from the strain, so that my clothes hung
loose.&#160; A monk behind me saw this and cutting a twig tied it so
tightly around my sides that it has caused my flesh to mortify."&#160;
Mochuda asked&#8212;"And why did you not loosen the twig?"&#160; The
monk replied&#8212;"Because my body in not my own and he who tied
it (the withe) has never loosed it."&#160; It was a whole year since
the withe had been fastened around him.&#160; Mochuda said to
him:&#8212;"Brother, you have suffered great pain; as a reward
thereof take now you choice&#8212;your restoration to bodily health
or spiritual health by immediate departure hence to eternal
life."&#160; He answered, deciding to go to heaven:&#8212;"Why should
I desire to remain in this life?"&#160; Having received the Sacrament
and the Holy Communion he departed hence to glory.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; There came to Mochuda on another occasion with her
husband, a woman named Brigh whose hand lay withered and useless by
her side:&#160; she besought the saint to cure her hand.&#160; Moreover
she was pregnant at the time.&#160; Mochuda held out an apple in his
hand to her as he had done before to Flandnait, the daughter of
Cuana, saying&#8212;"Alleluia, put forth your nerveless hand to
take this apple."&#160; She did as she was told and took the apple
from his hand and was cured; moreover as she tasted the fruit
parturition came on&#8212;without pain or inconvenience, after
which [the pair] returned to their home rejoicing.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; In fulfilment of the prophecy of Columcille and other
holy men that Mochuda should be expelled from Rahen the king of
Tara, Blathmac, the son of Aodh Slaine, and his brother Diarmuid
came, together with some clergy of the Cluain Earaird [Clonard]
community, to carry out the eviction [in A.D. 635].&#160; They said to
him, "Leave this monastery and region and seek a place for yourself
elsewhere."&#160; Mochuda replied&#8212;"In this place I have desired
to end my days.&#160; Here I have been many years serving God and have
almost reached the end of my life.&#160; Therefore I shall not depart
unless I am dragged hence by the hands against my will, for it is
not becoming an old man to abandon easily the place in which he has
spent great part of his life."&#160; Then the nobles returned to
Blathmac and they made various complaints of Mochuda, accusing him
falsely of many things; finally they asked the king to undertake
the expulsion personally, for they were themselves unequal to the
task.&#160; The king thereupon came to the place accompanied by a
large retinue.&#160; Alluding prophetically to the king's coming,
previous to that event, Mochuda said, addressing the
monks:&#8212;"Beloved brothers, get ready and gather your
belongings, for violence and eviction are close at hand:&#160; the
chieftains of this land are about to expel and banish you from your
own home."&#160; Then the king, with his brothers and many of the
chief men, arrived on the scene.&#160; They encamped near Rahen and
the king sent his brother Diarmuid with some others to expel
Mochuda and to put him out by force&#8212;which Diarmuid pledged
his word he should do.&#160; It was in the choir at prayer that
Diarmuid found Mochuda.&#160; Mochuda, though he knew his mission,
asked Diarmuid why he was come and what he sought.&#160; Diarmuid
replied that he came by order of King Blathmac to take him by the
hand and put him out of that establishment and to banish him from
Meath.&#160; "Do as you please," said Mochuda, "for we are prepared to
undergo all things for Christ's sake."&#160; "By my word," answered
Diarmuid, "I shall never be guilty of such a crime; let him who
chooses do it."&#160; Mochuda said:&#8212;"You shall possess the
kingdom of God and you shall reign in your brother's stead and your
face which you have turned from me shall never be turned from your
enemies.&#160; Moreover the reproaches which the king will presently
cast upon you for not doing the work he has set you, will be your
praise and your pride.&#160; At the same time as a penalty for your
evil designs toward me and your greater readiness to drive me out,
your son shall not succeed you in the sovereignty."&#160; Diarmuid
returned to the king and told him that he could do no injury to
Mochuda.&#160; The king retorted [sarcastically and] in anger, "What a
valiant man you are, Diarmuid."&#160; Diarmuid replied:&#8212;"That is
just what Mochuda promised&#8212;that I should be a warrior of
God."&#160; He was known as Diarmuid Ruanaidh thenceforth, for the
whole assembly cried out with one voice&#8212;truly he is Valiant
(<i>Ruanaidh</i>).</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Next, the nobles present cast lots to decide which one
of them should go with the king to lay hands on Mochuda and expel
him from the monastery.&#160; The lot fell upon the Herenach
[hereditary steward] of Cluain Earaird.&#160; He and the king
accompanied by armed men went to the monastery where they found
Mochuda and all the brethren in the church.&#160; Cronan, a certain
rich man in the company, shouted out, "Make haste with the business
on which you are come."&#160; Mochuda answered him&#8212;"You shall
die immediately, but on account of the alms which you gave me for
the love of Christ and on account of your uniform piety heretofore
your progeny shall prosper for ever."&#160; That prophecy has been
fulfilled.&#160; Another man, Dulach by name, winked mockingly with
one of his eyes; moreover he laughed and behaved irreverently
towards Mochuda.&#160; Mochuda said to him:&#8212;"Thus shall you
be&#8212;with one eye closed and a grin on your
countenance&#8212;to the end of your life; and of your descendants
many will be similarly afflicted."&#160; Yet another member of the
company, one Cailche, scurrilously abused and cursed Mochuda.&#160; To
him Mochuda said:&#8212;"Dysentery will attack you immediately and
murrain that will cause your death."&#160; The misfortune foretold
befell him and indeed woeful misfortune and ill luck pursued many
of them for their part in the wrong doing.&#160; When the king saw
these things he became furious and, advancing&#8212;himself and the
abbot of Cluain Earaird&#8212;they took each a hand of Mochuda and
in a disrespectful, uncivil manner, they led him forth out of the
monastery while their followers did the same with Mochuda's
community.&#160; Throughout the city and in the country around there
was among both sexes weeping, mourning, and wailing over their
humiliating expulsion from their own home and monastery.&#160; Even
amongst the soldiers of the king were many who were moved to pity
and compassion for Mochuda and his people.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; One of Mochuda's monks had gout in his foot and for him
Mochuda besought the king and his following that he, as he was
unable to travel, might be allowed to remain in the monastery; the
request was, however, refused.&#160; Mochuda called the monk to him
and, in the name of Christ, he commanded the pain to leave the foot
and to betake itself to the foot of Colman [Colman mac hua Telduib,
abbot, or perhaps erenach only, of Cluain Earaird], the chieftain
who was most unrelenting towards him.&#160; That soreness remained in
Colman's foot as long as he lived.&#160; The monk however rose up and
walked and was able to proceed on his way with his master.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; There was an aged monk who wished to be buried at Rahen;
Mochuda granted the request, and he received Holy Communion and
sacred rites at the saint's hands.&#160; Then he departed to heaven in
the presence of all and his body was buried at Rahen as he had
himself chosen that it should be.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Leaving Rahen Mochuda paid a visit to the monastic
cemetery weeping as he looked upon it; he blessed those interred
there and prayed for them.&#160; By the permission of God it happened
that the grave of a long deceased monk opened so that all saw it,
and, putting his head out of the grave, the tenant of the tomb
cried out in a loud voice:&#160; "O holy man and servant of God, bless
us that through thy blessing we may rise and go with you whither
you go."&#160; Mochuda replied:&#8212;"So novel a thing I shall not
do, for it behoves not to raise so large a number of people before
the general resurrection."&#160; The monk asked&#8212;"Why then
father, do you leave us, though we have promised union with you in
one place for ever?"&#160; Mochuda answered:&#8212;"Brother, have you
ever heard the proverb&#8212;<i>'necessitas movet decretum et
consilium'</i> (necessity is its own law)?&#160; Remain ye therefore
in your resting places and on the day of general resurrection I
shall come with all my brethren and we shall all assemble before
the great cross called 'Cross of the Angels' at the church door and
go together for judgement."&#160; When Mochuda had finished, the monk
lay back in his grave and the coffin closed.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda, with his following, next visited the cross
already mentioned and here, turning to the king, he thus addressed
him:&#8212;"Behold the heavens above you and the earth below."&#160;
The king looked at them:&#160; then Mochuda continued:&#8212;"Heaven
may you not possess and even from your earthly principality may you
soon be driven and your brother whom you have reproached, because
he would not lay hands on me, shall possess it instead of you, and
in your lifetime.&#160; You shall be despised by all&#8212;so much so
that in your brother's house they shall forget to supply you with
food.&#160; Moreover yourself and your children shall come to an evil
end and in a little while there shall not be one of your seed
remaining."&#160; Then Mochuda cursed him and he rang his small bell
against him and against his race, whence the bell has since been
known as "The Bell of Blathmac's Extinguishing," or "The Bell of
Blathmac's Drowning," because it drowned or extinguished Blathmac
with his posterity.&#160; Blathmac had a large family of sons and
daughters but, owing to Mochuda's curse, their race became
extinct.&#160; Next to the prince of Cluain Earaird who also had
seized him by the hand, he said:&#160; "You shall be a servant and a
bondman ere you die and you shall lose your territory and your race
will be a servile one."&#160; To another of those who led him by the
hand he said:&#8212;"What moved you to drag me by the hand from my
own monastery?"&#160; The other replied:&#8212;"It pleased me not that
a Munster man should have such honour in Meath."&#160; "I wish," said
Mochuda, "that the hand you laid on me may be accursed and that the
face you turned against me to expel me from my home may be
repulsive and scrofulous for the remainder of your life."&#160; This
curse was effective for the man's eye was thereupon destroyed in
his head.&#160; Mochuda noticed that some of Columcille's successors
and people from Durrow, which was one of Columcille's foundations,
had taken part in his eviction.&#160; He thus addressed
them:&#8212;"Contention and quarrelling shall be yours for ever to
work evil and schism amongst you&#8212;for you have had a prominent
part in exciting opposition to me."&#160; And so it fell out.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; The king and his people thereupon compelled Mochuda to
proceed on his way.&#160; Mochuda did proceed with his disciples,
eight hundred and sixty seven in number (and as many more they left
buried in Rahen).&#160; Moreover, many more living disciples of his
who had lived in various parts of Ireland were already dead.&#160; All
the community abounded in grace:&#160; many of its members became
bishops and abbots in after years and they erected many churches to
the glory of God.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Understand, moreover, that great was the charity of the
holy bishop, as the following fact will prove:&#8212;in a cell
without the city of Rahen he maintained in comfort and
respectability a multitude of lepers.&#160; He frequently visited them
and ministered to them himself&#8212;entrusting that office to no
one else.&#160; It was known to all the lepers of Ireland how Mochuda
made their fellow-sufferers his special care and family, and the
result was that an immense number of lepers from all parts flocked
to him and he took charge and care of them.&#160; These on his
departure from Rahen he took with him to Lismore where he prepared
suitable quarters for them and there they have been ever since in
comfort and in honour according to Mochuda's command.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; As Mochuda and his people journeyed along with their
vehicles they found the way blocked by a large tree which lay
across it.&#160; Owing to the density of underwood at either side they
were unable to proceed.&#160; Some one announced:&#8212;"There is a
tree across the road before us, so that we cannot advance."&#160;
Mochuda said:&#160; "In the name of Christ I command thee, tree, to
rise up and stand again in thy former place."&#160; At the command of
Mochuda the tree stood erect as it was originally and it still
retains its former appearance, and there is a pile of stones there
at its base to commemorate the miracle.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; It was necessary to proceed; the first night after
Mochuda's departure from Rahen the place that he came to was a cell
called Drum Cuilinn [Drumcullen], on the confines of Munster,
Leinster, and Clanna Neill, but actually within Clanna Neill,
scil.:&#8212;in the territory of Fearceall in which also is
Rahen.&#160; In Drum Cuilinn dwelt the holy abbot, Barrfhinn, renowned
for miracles.&#160; On the morrow Mochuda arrived at Saighir Chiarain
[Seirkieran] and the following night at the establishment where
Cronan is now, scil.:&#8212;Roscrea.&#160; That night Mochuda remained
without entertainment although it was offered to them by Cronan who
had prepared supper for him.&#160; Mochuda refused however to go to it
saying that he would not go out of his way to visit a man who
avoids guests and builds his cell in a wild bog far from men and
that such a man's proper guests are creatures of the wilderness
instead of human beings.&#160; When Cronan heard this saying of
Mochuda he came to the latter, by whose advice he abandoned his
hermitage in the bog and he, with Mochuda, marked out the site of a
new monastery and church at Roscrea.&#160; There he founded a great
establishment and there he is himself buried.&#160; Mochuda took leave
of Cronan and, travelling through Eile [Ely O'Carroll], came to the
royal city named Cashel.&#160; On the following day the king,
scil.:&#8212;Failbhe [Failbhe Flann], came to Mochuda offering him
a place whereon to found a church.&#160; Mochuda replied:&#8212;"It is
not permitted us by God to stay our journey anywhere till we come
to the place promised to us by the holy men."</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; About the same time there came messengers from the king
of Leinster to the king of Munster praying the latter, by virtue of
league and alliance, to come to his assistance as Leath-Chuinn and
the north were advancing in great force to ravage Leinster.&#160; This
is how Failbhe was situated at the time:&#160; he had lost one of his
eyes and he was ashamed to go half-blind into a strange
territory.&#160; As soon as Mochuda realised the extent of the king's
diffidence he blessed the eye making on it the sign of the cross
and it was immediately healed in the presence of all.&#160; The king
and Mochuda took leave of one another and went each his own way.&#160;
The king and his hosting went to the aid of Leinster in the
latter's necessity.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda journeyed on through Muscraige Oirthir the chief
of which territory received him with great honour.&#160; Aodhan was
the chief's name and he bestowed his homestead called Isiol
[Athassel] on Mochuda, who blessed him and his seed.&#160; Next he
came into the Decies.&#160; He travelled through Magh Femin where he
broke his journey at Ard Breanuinn [Ardfinnan] on the bank of the
Suir.&#160; There came to him here Maolochtair, king of the Decies,
and the other nobles [or one noble, Suibhne] of his nation who were
at variance with him concerning land.&#160; Mochuda by the grace of
God made peace amongst them, and dismissed them in amity.&#160;
Maolochtair gave that land to Mochuda who marked out a cell there
where is now the city of Ardfinnnan, attached to which is a large
parish subject to Mochuda and bearing his name.&#160; The wife of
Maolochtair, scil:&#8212;Cuciniceas, daughter of Failbhe Flann,
king of Munster, had a vision, viz.:&#8212;a flock of very
beautiful birds flying above her head and one bird was more
beautiful and larger than the rest.&#160; The other birds followed
this one and it nestled in the king's bosom.&#160; Soon as she awoke
she related the vision to the king; the king observed:&#160; "Woman
you have dreamed a good dream and soon it will be realised; the
flock of birds you have seen is Mochuda with his monks coming from
Rahen and the most distinguished bird is Mochuda himself.&#160; And
the settling in my bosom means that the place of his resurrection
will be in my territory.&#160; Many blessings will come to us and our
territory through him."&#160; That vision of the faithful woman was
realised as the faithful king had explained it.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Subsequently Mochuda came to Maolochtair requesting from
him a place where he might erect a monastery.&#160; Maolochtair
replied:&#160; "So large a community cannot dwell in such a narrow
place."&#160; Mochuda said:&#160; "God, who sent us to you, will show you
a place suited to us."&#160; The king answered:&#8212;"I have a place,
convenient for fish and wood, beside Slieve Gua on the bank of the
Nemh but I fear it will not be large enough."&#160; Mochuda
said:&#8212;"It will not be narrow; there is a river and fish and
that it shall be the place of our resurrection."&#160; Thereupon, in
the presence of many witnesses, the king handed over the land,
scil.:&#8212;Lismore, to God and Mochuda and it is in that place
Mochuda afterwards founded his famous city.&#160; Mochuda blessed the
king and his wife as well as the nobles and all the people and
taking leave of them and receiving their homage he journeyed across
Slieve Gua till he came to the church called Ceall Clochair
[Kilcloher].&#160; The saint of that church, scil.:&#8212;Mochua
Mianain, prepared a supper for Mochuda to the best of his ability,
but he had only a single barrel of ale for them all.&#160; Although
Mochuda with his people remained there three days and three nights
and although the holy abbot (Mochua) continued to draw the ale into
small vessels to serve the company, according to their needs, the
quantity in the barrel grew no less but increased after the manner
of the oil blessed by Elias [3 Kings 17:16].&#160; Then one of the
monks said to Mochuda, "If you remain in this place till the feast
ends your stay will be a long one for it (the entertainment) grows
no smaller for all the consumption."&#160; "That is true, brother,"
said Mochuda and it is fitting for us to depart now."&#160; They
started therefore on their way and Mochua Mianain gave himself and
his place to God and Mochuda for ever.&#160; On Mochuda's departure
the ale barrel drained out to the lees.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda proceeded till he reached the river Nemh at a
ford called Ath-Mheadhon [Affane] which no one could cross except a
swimmer or a very strong person at low water in a dry season of
summer heat, for the tide flows against the stream far as Lismore,
five miles further up.&#160; On this particular occasion it happened
to be high tide.&#160; The two first of Mochuda's people to reach the
ford were the monks Molua and Colman, while Mochuda himself came
last.&#160; They turned round to him and said that it was not possible
to cross the river till the ebb.&#160; Mochuda
answered:&#8212;"Advance through the water before the others in the
name of your Lord Jesus Christ for He is the way the truth and the
life" [John 14:6].&#160; As soon as they heard this command of
Mochuda's Molua said to Colman, "Which of the two will you hold
back&#8212;the stream above or the sea below?"&#160; Colman
answered:&#8212;"Let each restrain that which is nearest to
him"&#8212;for Molua was on the upper, or stream, side and Colman
on the lower, or sea, side.&#160; Molua said to Colman&#8212;"Forbid
you the sea side to flow naturally and I shall forbid the stream
side."&#160; Then with great faith they proceeded to cross the river;
they signed the river with the sign of Christ's cross and the
waters stood on either hand and apart, so that the dry earth
appeared between.&#160; The side banks of water rose high because
there was no passage up or down, so that the ridges were very
elevated on both the sea and stream sides.&#160; The waters remained
thus till such time as all Mochuda's people had crossed.&#160; Mochuda
himself was the last to pass over and the path across was so level
that it offered no obstacle to foot-passengers or chariots but was
like a level plain so that they crossed dryshod, as the Jordan fell
back for Josue the son of Nun [Josue 3:17].&#160; Soon as Mochuda had
crossed over he blessed the waters and commanded them to resume
their natural course.&#160; On the reuniting again of the waters they
made a noise like thunder, and the name of the place is The Place
of Benedictions, from the blessings of Mochuda and his people.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Next the glorious bishop, Mochuda, proceeded to the
place promised to him by God and the prophets, which place is the
plain called Magh-Sciath.&#160; Mochuda, with the holy men, blessed
the place and dedicated there the site of a church in circular
form.&#160; There came to them a holy woman named Caimell who had a
cell there and she asked, "What do you propose doing here, ye
servants of God?"&#160; "We propose," answered Mochuda, "building here
a little <i>Lios</i> [enclosure] around our possession."&#160; Caimell
observed, "Not a little Lios will it be but a great [<i>mor</i>]
one (Lis-mor)."&#160; "True indeed, virgin," responded Mochuda,
"Lismore will be its name for ever."&#160; The virgin offered herself
and her cell to God and Mochuda for ever, where the convent of
women is now established in the city of Lismore.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; As Colman Elo, alluded to already, promised, Mochuda
found his burial place marked out (consecrated?) by angels; there
he and a multitude of his disciples are buried and it was made
known to him by divine wisdom the number of holy persons that to
the end of the world would be buried therein.&#160; Lismore is a
renowned city, for there is one portion of it which no woman may
enter and there are within it many chapels and monasteries, and in
which there are always multitudes of devout people not from Ireland
alone but from the land of the Saxons and from Britain and from
other lands as well.&#160; This is its situation&#8212;on the south
bank of the Avonmore in the Decies territory.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; On a certain day there came a druid to Mochuda to argue
and contend with him.&#160; He said:&#8212;"If you be a servant of God
cause natural fruit to grow on this withered branch."&#160; Mochuda
knew that it was to throw contempt on the power of God that the
druid had come.&#160; He blessed the branch and it produced first
living skin, then, as the druid had asked&#8212;leaves, blossom and
fruit in succession.&#160; The druid marvelled exceedingly and went
his way.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; A poor man came to Mochuda on another occasion with an
ill timed request for milk, and beer along with it.&#160; Mochuda was
at the time close by the well which is known as "Mochuda's Well" at
the present time; this he blessed changing it first into milk then
into beer and finally to wine.&#160; Then he told the poor man to take
away whatever quantity of each of these liquids he required.&#160; The
well remained thus till at Mochuda's prayer it returned to its
original condition again.&#160; An angel came from heaven to Mochuda
at the time and told him that the well should remain a source of
health and virtues and of marvels, and it still, like every well
originally blessed by Mochuda, possesses power of healing from
every malady.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; Mochuda, now grown old and of failing powers and
strength, was wearied and worried by the incessant clamour of
building operations&#8212;the dressing of stones and
timber&#8212;carried on by the multitude of monks and artisans.&#160;
He therefore by consent and counsel of the brethren retired to a
remote, lonely place situated in a glen called "Mochuda's Inch"
below the great monastery.&#160; He took with him there a few monks
and built a resplendent monastery; he remained in that place a year
and six months more leading a hermitical life.&#160; The brethren and
seniors of the community visited him (from time to time) and he
gave them sound, sweetly-reasoned advice.&#160; He received a vow from
each to follow his Rule, for he was the support of the aged, the
health-giver to the weak, the consoler of the afflicted, the
hope-giver to the hopeless, the faith-giver to the doubting, the
moderator and uniter of the young.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; As soon as Mochuda saw the hardship to the visiting
brothers and elders of the descent from Lismore and the ascent
thereto again&#8212;knowing at the same time that his end was
approaching&#8212;he ordered himself to be carried up to the
monastery so that the monks might be saved the fatigue of the
descent to him.&#160; Then it pleased God to call to Himself His
devoted servant from the troubles of life and to render to him the
reward of his good works.&#160; He opened the gates of heaven then and
sent to him a host of angels, in glory and majesty unspeakable.&#160;
When Mochuda saw the heavens open above him and the angel band
approaching, he ordered that he be set down in the middle of the
glen and he related to the seniors the things that he had seen and
he asked to receive the Body of Christ and he gave his last
instruction to the monks&#8212;to observe the Law of God and keep
His commands.&#160; The place was by the cross called <i>"Crux
Migrationis,"</i> or the cross from which Mochuda departed to
Glory.&#160; Having received the Body and Blood of Christ, having
taught them divine doctrines, in the midst of holy choirs and of
many brethren and monks to whom in turn he gave his blessing and
the kiss of peace according to the rule, the glorious and holy
bishop departed to heaven accompanied by hosts of angels on the day
before the Ides of May [May 14], in his union with the Holy
Trinity&#8212;Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for ever and ever.&#160;
Amen.</p>

<h4>NOTE 1</h4>
<p>One of our scribe's predecessors omitted a word or two from the
text here, with disastrous results to the sense.&#160; The Latin Life
comes to our aid however and enables us to make good the omission;
the latter, by the way, puzzles our scribe who is like a man
fighting an invisible enemy&#8212;correcting a text of which he
does not know the defect.&#160; Insertion of the words "walking
backwards" immediately after "church," in the angel's answer, will
enable us to see the original writer's meaning.&#160; The text should
probably read:</p>
<blockquote>The angel answered:&#8212;"Whom you shall see going
from the church walking backwards to the guest-house" (for it was
Mochuda's custom to walk backwards from the door of the church).&#160;
Comghall announced to his household that there was coming to them a
distinguished stranger, well-beloved of God, of whose advent an
angel had twice foretold him.&#160; Some time later Mochuda arrived at
Comghall's establishment, and he went to the monastery first and he
did just as the angel foretold of him and Comghall recognised him
and bade him welcome.</blockquote>

<h4>Transcriber's Note</h4>
<p>The source for this
text includes the Irish text and English translation on facing
pages and notes.&#160; The notes are quite lengthy and should take
longer to transcribe than the English text.&#160; Except for a few
notes transplanted in brackets to the body of the text I have not
transcribed them.&#160; Due to inexperience with the Irish language
and its script I have decided not to attempt to transcribe the
Irish text.&#160; Hopefully someone with the appropriate talent and
interest will undertake that task some day.&#160; I have corrected the
errata as indicated in the source and a few obvious printer
errors.&#160; Please note that this text contains variant spellings of
names and words sometimes inconsistently applied.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
